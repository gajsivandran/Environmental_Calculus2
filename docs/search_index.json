Welcome to Calculus for Environmental Science.  This book is your companion for exploring the natural world through the lens of calculus—especially the powerful ideas of change and accumulation. You’ll find that calculus is not just about symbols on a page—it’s about asking meaningful questions, interpreting patterns, and making sense of complex environmental systems. And along the way, you’ll see that you are absolutely capable of mastering these ideas. 1.1 Why This Book? Most calculus textbooks lean heavily on physics examples—motion, velocity, and acceleration—because calculus was originally developed to solve physics problems. Those examples are powerful, and we’ll use them from time to time because they give us an intuitive “feel” for how change works. But today, calculus is a tool used across many disciplines: biology, ecology, environmental science, economics, engineering, and beyond. In this book, we’ll focus on examples that resonate with your studies and your interests as an environmental scientist. Environmental scientists face some of the most urgent and complex challenges of our time—climate change, biodiversity loss, resource management, and pollution. Calculus gives us tools to: Predict how systems evolve over time Estimate impacts and risks Model natural and human systems with differential equations Analyze rates of change and long-term accumulation Throughout this book, you’ll work with real environmental data, use visual and conceptual approaches, and practice skills that matter for sustainability. Our goal is not just to “get through calculus,” but to see how these mathematical ideas open doors for discovery and problem-solving in the real world. 1.2 What Is Calculus? At its heart, calculus is the mathematics of change and accumulation. These two ideas are everywhere in science: The rate of CO₂ increase in the atmosphere is a derivative. The total added CO₂ over a year is an integral. Traditionally, calculus is first introduced through physics examples like velocity (rate of change of position) and acceleration (rate of change of velocity). These are helpful because most of us can feel what it means to move faster or slower. We’ll use those examples when they make ideas clearer. But throughout this book, our main goal is to connect calculus directly to the environment you are studying. You’ll see derivatives and integrals applied to population growth, forest carbon storage, water flow in rivers, and other natural systems. We’ll build your understanding of these concepts step by step, supported by graphs, data, and hands-on examples. And if it’s been a while since your last math class, that’s completely okay—you’ll find plenty of support here. We’ll meet you where you are and grow your skills together. 1.3 How This Book Works Each chapter is designed to support you as a learner. You’ll find: Clear explanations of key concepts Environmental examples to connect math with meaning Practice problems to strengthen your skills Reflection prompts to help you think about what you’re learning 1.4 Success in This Class First and foremost, know this: we believe in your ability to learn and grow. You bring unique strengths and perspectives, and your effort matters here. Mistakes are not a setback—they are the very heart of learning. When you get something wrong, you uncover where your thinking needs refinement, and that creates the space for real growth. Struggle is not a sign you don’t belong; it’s proof that your brain is stretching and building new connections. Just like in science, learning calculus is about iteration—trying, testing, revising, and improving. That process is what makes your understanding deeper and more durable. Assessments in this class are snapshots of your thinking at a particular moment in time. They are not final judgments about your intelligence, your worth, or your potential. You will have chances to revisit concepts, refine your understanding, and demonstrate what you’ve learned. Growth comes from re-engaging with the material, not from perfection on the first try. So give yourself permission to be imperfect. Keep engaging, reflecting, and asking questions. We’ll be here to support you every step of the way. 1.5 Looking Ahead By the end of this course, you will be able to: Apply calculus concepts to natural systems Analyze environmental data with confidence Interpret and communicate your results to others But even more important than any specific skill, you’ll leave this course with a stronger belief in your ability to learn mathematics. Calculus is not just a hurdle to clear—it’s a tool that expands how you see and understand the world. Our hope is that by connecting it to the environment you care about, you’ll discover both its usefulness and its beauty. Most importantly, you’ll leave with the confidence to keep growing—using mathematics as a tool to explore, protect, and better understand the natural world around you. 1.6 ⚠️ A Big Disclaimer ⚠️ I started writing this textbook to create a calculus resource that speaks directly to your interests as environmental scientists. My goal is to make calculus feel relevant, supportive, and connected to the systems you care about. That said, this is very much a work in progress. This draft will have typos, rough edges, and the occasional mistake. But here’s the good news: it’s also free.  If you come across an error—big or small—please let me know so I can fix it for you and for future students. Your feedback is not just welcome, it’s essential to making this a better resource. Thanks for your patience, your sharp eyes, and your willingness to learn from (and with) an evolving text. Together, we’ll keep improving it.

Track units through computations and check results for reasonableness. Build and evaluate a simple model for an environmental variable as a function of time and elevation. It may have been a while since you last used some of your pre-calculus knowledge. Don’t worry if certain topics feel unfamiliar—we’ll walk through each concept with context and practice. This chapter is designed to help you review and refresh the foundational math skills that will support your success in this course. Think of it as a toolbox: later chapters will point to specific tools you’ll need to solve real problems, and those are the ideal moments to revisit them. Concepts stick best when learned in context—so come back to this chapter anytime you need a quick refresher. 2.2 What You’re Expected to Know To get the most out of this course, you should feel reasonably comfortable with: Working with functions and interpreting graphs Manipulating algebraic equations Rules for exponents and logarithms Understanding and converting units Reading and setting up word problems If these topics feel rusty, that’s perfectly normal. This chapter is here to get you back up to speed—and to remind you that you already have more tools than you might think. 2.3 How to Approach Calculus Problems Understanding calculus isn’t about memorizing steps—it’s about learning to think mathematically so you can interpret real-world change. It’s normal for parts of this to feel unfamiliar at first; progress comes from trying, checking, and revising. In this course, we’ll model environmental systems—temperature, rainfall, population dynamics—and the goal is clarity, not perfection on the first attempt. When you get stuck, start small: sketch the situation, label axes and units, compute one example value, and say out loud what a slope or an area means in context. Treat mistakes as information, not judgment—they show you what to try next. Keep going; you’re building tools you’ll use well beyond this class. Here’s a strategy to help you become a more confident problem solver: 2.3.1 Clarify the Ask What is being asked? Is the question about a rate of change, a maximum/minimum, or an accumulated quantity? What type of function or scenario is involved (linear, quadratic, exponential, etc.)? Always start by identifying what quantities are changing and how they’re related. 2.3.2 List the Givens Write down the given information clearly. Label all variables, units, and known values. If a graph or context is given, sketch or summarize what you see. Clarity in setup is half the solution. 2.3.3 Translate the Math Equations are not just symbols—they are instructions: Each term contributes to the behavior of the function. Operators (+, −, ×, ÷, …) tell you what actions to take. Derivatives tell you how the function is changing. Don’t rush through the algebra. Pause and ask: “What is this term telling me?” 2.3.4 Work Step by Step Instead of aiming straight for the final answer, focus on the process: Write out what you’re doing and why. If you take a derivative, explain what it represents (e.g., “This is the rate of change of population over time.”) Label your steps so they can be traced logically. When taking notes, don’t just copy answers. Write procedures and reasoning—this builds transferable understanding. 2.3.5 Reflect and Interpret Does your answer make sense in context? Are the units correct? Is the magnitude reasonable? What does your result say about the system you’re studying? In environmental science, the interpretation is as important as the calculation. 2.3.6 Growth Mindset You may not see math in every class you take—that’s okay. Our goal here is to build confidence and numerical literacy. Solving math problems is a step-by-step process. Thinking too far ahead can cause confusion. Take it one step at a time—that’s how you make progress. Also, try not to overthink mid-solution. If you tried to narrate every muscle movement while climbing stairs, you might trip. Trust yourself. Don’t second-guess every step—work through to the end. When you reflect, you’ll catch errors and sharpen your thinking. Confidence grows by doing. Keep moving forward—even imperfect progress builds understanding. Athletes know this: when you overanalyze your swing while swinging, performance often gets worse. Much of skilled work is partly automatic. Bringing every detail into the conscious mind can interrupt your flow. Trust your instincts. Don’t be afraid to commit to your approach. Swing through—you’ll learn more by finishing a solution than by freezing in doubt. 2.4 How We Communicate Relationships By thinking of functions as input-output machines and visualizing them on a graph, you’ll be better equipped to interpret and model relationships in environmental systems and beyond. A function represents a relationship between two quantities: an input and an output. The way we represent and communicate this is through: Verbal descriptions Graphical representations like charts Tables of data Formulas that capture the relationship Your Turn In a small group describe how the air temperature has changed in the last 24 hours. Write a statement describing the air temperature Graphically represent your description Create a table that represents your discussion Attempt to write an equation Now discuss the pros and cons of each of the methods. Discuss what you can and can’t do with each description of the temperature and time relationship. Discussion Prompt How does air temperature change with elevation as you hike up a mountain? Can we describe that change with a function? As you move upward through the atmosphere, the temperature typically drops at a fairly predictable rate. This is called the adiabatic lapse rate, which averages around 6.5°C per 1000 meters (or about 1°C per 154 meters). You’ll use this rule to model how the temperature changes from Seattle (sea level) to the summit of Mount Rainier (4392 m). Assume the temperature at sea level in Seattle is 18°C. Let’s use our approach to problem solving: What is the ask? What are we given? Translate the Math &amp; Work step-by-step We can translate this word problem into a table. Use the lapse rate to compute the temperature at the following elevations: Elevation (m) Temperature (°C) 0 (Seattle) 1000 2000 3000 4000 We could visualize this data by plotting these points on a graph Use R or graph paper to create a quick sketch of the temperature vs. elevation relationship. Figure 2.1: Air temperature (degC) as a function of time (hours) Finally we could attempt to write a function Use the pattern in the data to define a linear function that models temperature as a function of elevation. Let: \\(T(h)\\) = temperature at elevation \\(h\\) (in meters) Assume \\(T(0) = 18\\) and use the lapse rate to define the slope \\(T(h) =\\) Reflect and Interpret Does you answer make sense? Does it pass the sniff test? Is that what you observe when you go hiking? What does the slope of your function represent? What temperature do you predict at 4392 meters (Mount Rainier’s summit)? 2.5 Functions and Their Representations In the last activity we wrote a simple function. Now let’s take a step back and make sure we understand what functions mean and how they work. 2.5.1 Understanding What \\(f(x)\\) Means You’ve probably seen the equation of a line written like this: \\[ y = mx + b \\] This is the same as writing: \\[ f(x) = mx + b \\] Both notations describe the same relationship. Here’s what they mean: \\(x\\) is the input (what you plug into the function). \\(f(x)\\) or \\(y\\) is the output (what comes out after applying the function rule). Graphically: The input is usually plotted along the x-axis. The output (\\(y\\) or \\(f(x)\\)) is plotted along the y-axis. So when you see a point like \\((4, 11)\\), it means: Input \\(x = 4\\) produces output \\(f(x) = 11\\). A function is like a black box: you put something in, a rule is applied, and you get something out. For example: \\[ f(x) = 2x + 3 \\] If we input \\(x = 4\\): \\[ f(4) = 2 \\cdot 4 + 3 = 11 \\] So the point \\((4, 11)\\) would appear on the graph. Input: \\(x = 4\\) Rule: multiply by 2, then add 3 Output: \\(f(4) = 11\\) 2.5.2 Functions Don’t Have to Be Named \\(f\\) Functions can be named in ways that make their meaning clearer. For example: \\(T(t)\\) for temperature as a function of time \\(P(n)\\) for population as a function of years The variable also doesn’t always have to be \\(x\\). Choosing names that match the context makes your math easier to read, easier to explain, and easier to connect to the real world. 2.5.2.1 Why Meaningful Function Names Matter Suppose we want to model how land temperature T (in °C) changes with distance d (in km) from the shore. We could write the function in a very generic way: \\[ f(x) = 0.2x + 3 \\] Here, f is the temperature and x is the distance. This works mathematically, but it doesn’t tell us much about what the variables mean. A clearer way is to use variables that match the context: \\[ T(d) = 0.2d + 3 \\] Now the function communicates something immediately: \\(T(d)\\) = land temperature (°C) \\(d\\) = distance from the coast (km) This version is not only valid but more meaningful: “Temperature increases by 0.2°C for every kilometer inland, starting from 3°C at the coast.” By naming functions and variables in ways that reflect the system being studied, we make the math easier to interpret, easier to explain, and easier to apply. 2.5.3 Functions Can Have More Than One Input \\(\\, f(x,y)\\) Many environmental processes depend on more than one variable. For example, the distribution of a terrestrial species might be best described as a function of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), where \\(x\\) is longitude and \\(y\\) is latitude. Thinking further: what would the function look like for the location of a species in three dimensions, such as mapping their position in a water column? How would you write this mathematically? In reality, many environmental systems depend on far more than three variables. When building models, the art is in simplifying: choosing the key variables that matter most for the question at hand. Including every possible factor would be too complex to work with, so we focus on what’s essential. Discussion Prompt In a group discuss the factors that control the growth of a tree. Write a pseudo-equation that takes the form of \\[ \\text{Growth} = f(\\text{Variable 1}, \\text{Variable 2}, \\ldots) \\] How many variables drive the growth of a tree? Activity: Modeling Temperature as a Function of Time and Elevation Learning Goals Understand how to construct and interpret a function of two variables. Apply environmental context to multivariable functions. Visualize how elevation impacts the daily temperature cycle using lapse rate. At sea level, the temperature throughout the day is modeled by: \\(T(t) = 10 - 5 \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) [°C]\\) Temperature decreases with elevation, at a lapse rate of 6.5°C per 1000 meters: \\(L= \\frac{6.5}{1000} = 0.0065 [\\frac{°C}{m}]\\) The temperature as a function of elevation alone (assuming sea level temperature is 10°C): \\(T(h) = 10 - 0.0065 \\cdot h\\) So the temperature as a function of both time t and elevation h is: \\(T(t, h) = 10 - 5 \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) - 0.0065 \\cdot h\\) ## time elevation temperature ## 1 6 0 10.00 ## 2 6 500 6.75 ## 3 6 1500 0.25 ## 4 12 0 15.00 ## 5 12 1000 8.50 ## 6 18 2000 -3.00 ## 7 18 5000 -22.50 Reflection: At what time of day is the temperature difference between sea level and 2000 m greatest? What happens to the daily temperature range as elevation increases? Does the timing of the warmest part of the day change with elevation? Stare at this equation T(t, h) = 10 - 5 * cos(pi * t / 12) - 0.0065 * h, can you visualize the impact of t? what about h? The equation could have been written as f(x, y) = 10 - 5 * cos(pi * x / 12) - 0.0065 * y, would this be harder to interpret? Figure 2.2: Apply the function to compute temperature 2.6 Graphing and Interpreting Change Understanding the shape of a graph is crucial for interpreting real-world phenomena. Here are key features to notice: Increasing/Decreasing: Is the function going up or down as \\(x\\) increases? Peaks and Valleys: Where are the local maxima and minima? Concavity: Does the curve bend upward (concave up) or downward (concave down)? Let’s look at an example of a quadratic function, which is commonly used to model situations with a single peak or valley. This function is an increasing function for \\(x&lt;2\\) and decreasing for \\(x&gt;2\\). It has a maximum at \\(x=2\\). We can also notice that the concavity of the function is concave down. We can also look at the how the function is changing as we move along the x axis. At \\(x=2\\) the slope of the function is positive and steep. As we approach the maximum, the slope of the function is still positive, but its not increasing as fast. We could say its increasing at a decreasing rate. At the peak, the function is not longer changing. Now as we pass \\(x=2\\) the function is decreasing slowly at first, but faster and faster as \\(x\\) gets further away from the peak. You can think of this as a ball in your hand. You throw it up, initially its moving fast, but as gravity acts on the ball it slows. Then for an instance, the ball hangs in the air - this is where it reaches its peak. Then the ball starts to fall, slowly at first, but it then begins to fall faster and faster. The calculus you will learn in this course will give you the tools needed to quatify these observations. Identify the rates of change at different point and find the maximas and minimas. 2.7 Key Function Types Here are five common functions you’ll encounter: Function Type Form Environmental Example Linear \\(y = mx + b\\) Streamflow increasing over time Quadratic \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) Pollution dispersal from a point source Exponential \\(y = a \\cdot b^x\\) Invasive species growth Logarithmic \\(y = \\log(x)\\) pH or sound intensity Mini Exercise Match the following environmental situations with function types: 1. Forest biomass grows rapidly, then levels off. 2. A spill’s impact decreases as you move downstream. 3. A steady rise in sea level over time. Discussion Prompt What environmental processes could you model with these functions. See if you can identify some additional real-world examples for each graph. Sketch the rough shapes of these functions and identify some of their key features? 2.8 Units, Rates, and Word Problems Units are a scientist’s best friend. They don’t just tell us what we’re measuring—they also help us check if our answers make sense. In calculus, units play a central role because they give meaning to rates of change (derivatives) and accumulations (integrals). Here are some common examples in environmental science: Atmospheric CO₂ concentration is measured in ppm (parts per million). Rainfall might be reported in mm/hour. Streamflow can be given in m³/s (cubic meters per second). Tree growth might be in cm/year. 2.8.1 Why Units Matter Think of units as guardrails for problem solving: They help you avoid mistakes (e.g., mixing meters with kilometers). They give physical meaning to abstract symbols. They allow you to compare across systems and scales. If your answer has the wrong units, it’s almost certainly the wrong answer. 2.8.1.1 A Famous Example: The Mars Orbiter Mishap  In 1999, NASA lost the Mars Climate Orbiter, a spacecraft that cost $390 million to design, build, and launch—all because of a simple unit conversion error. One engineering team used English units (pound-seconds of force). Another team assumed metric units (Newton-seconds). The mismatch went unnoticed, and the spacecraft’s trajectory was off course. The result: the orbiter entered Mars’ atmosphere at the wrong altitude and was destroyed. This dramatic example shows why scientists and engineers obsess over units. While our classroom mistakes won’t crash a $390 million spacecraft, they can still derail your reasoning. Keeping track of units is one of the simplest—and most powerful—ways to check your work. Activity: Average Rate of Change Suppose atmospheric CO₂ increases from 400 ppm to 420 ppm over 5 years. Calculate the average rate of change Now repeat the procee but this time no numbers, run the same calculation with just the units. What do you end up with? Now tell me the sotry of what your calculation means? Reflection Questions What if we reported the time in months instead of years? How would the rate change? What if the increase had been 400 → 420 ppm in 10 years — what happens to the rate? Does “average rate” mean CO₂ increased by exactly 4 ppm every year? Why or why not? 2.8.2 Key Idea A rate of change always involves comparing how much one quantity changes relative to another. \\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Change in Output}}{\\text{Change in Input}} \\] If the input is time, the rate tells us “how fast” something changes. If the input is distance, the rate might describe a gradient (e.g., temperature lapse rate with elevation). If the input is volume, the rate might describe a concentration per unit volume. Units don’t just check your work—they tell the story of what the math means. 2.9 Getting Comfortable with Word Problems Environmental word problems are at the heart of applying calculus. They take a real-world situation and ask you to identify the quantities involved, describe how they are changing, and build a model that captures those changes. When you read a word problem, pause and ask yourself: What is changing? (What’s the variable of interest?) How fast is it changing? (Are we talking about a rate or an accumulated total?) What influences that change? (Is it driven by time, distance, elevation, or something else?) 2.9.1 Why Word Problems Matter Anyone can compute a derivative or an integral once the equation is written down. The real challenge—and the real skill—is translating words into math. That’s what lets you use calculus to model glaciers, forests, rivers, or populations. Remember: there is no single “right” way to start. Sketching, making a table, or writing down what you know in words are all valid first steps. 2.9.2 Example Problem A glacier is melting at a rate that increases each year. What mathematical tools would help you model this? Step 1. What’s changing? The glacier’s thickness or volume is decreasing. Step 2. How is it changing? The rate of melt is itself increasing over time. That means the rate is not constant. Step 3. What tools do we need? A derivative describes the melt rate at a given moment. An integral (this is a preview of 292) could estimate the total ice lost over a span of years. Because the rate is changing, an exponential or quadratic function might be a better fit than a linear one. Activity: Rate of change around us What other environmental situations involve a rate that changes over time (not just a constant rate)? Discuss and share back with the class How would you represent this glacier problem with a graph? With a table? If you only had measurements of ice thickness each year, how would you estimate the rate of change? 2.9.3 Key Idea Word problems are really about translation. You’re moving between: Verbal description → “the glacier is melting faster each year” Mathematical model → equations that capture this trend Interpretation → what the math tells us about the glacier and its future The math is the language, but the story is always about the system you’re studying. 2.10 Practice: Interpreting Functions 2.10.1 What Are You Practicing? In this section, you’ll get more comfortable reading, interpreting, and evaluating functions — especially those that model environmental systems. You’ll see functions written in different forms (formulas, graphs, tables), and you’ll practice thinking about what the input and output represent. This is an important foundation for calculus. When we interpret derivatives later on, we’ll always come back to what is this function telling us about the real world? 2.10.2 How to Approach These Problems For any function, try answering these three questions: What are the input(s) and output? What does the function take in, and what does it give back? What do the variables represent? For example, is \\(t\\) time? Is \\(T(t)\\) a temperature? What are the units? What does the formula tell you about the relationship? If the function is increasing or decreasing, by how much? Are there any constants or slopes that describe rates? 2.10.3 Practice Problems Try these on your own or with a partner. Don’t just plug in numbers — ask what the function is saying!

What might the graph of this function look like? c. What does it suggest about the plant’s growth? d. If you were to plug in a (very) large value for t what happens? Does the result make sense? How could you restrict this function? 6. A temperature function is defined as: \\(T(h) = 15 - 0.0065h\\), where \\(h\\) is elevation in meters above sea level. a. What is the temperature at sea level? b. How much does the temperature drop every 1000 meters? c. At what elevation will the temperature be 0°C?  Level 3: Challenging Interpretation 7. A water tank is being filled and drained at the same time. The volume of water is modeled by: \\(V(t) = 100 + 30t - 2t^2\\), where \\(V\\) is volume in liters and \\(t\\) is time in minutes. a. What kind of function is this? b. Looking at the expressions, can you explain what each term might be doing? c. Explain What happens to the volume over time?

[Hint: try putting this into DESMOS to visualize] 2.11 Practice: Reading Graphs &amp; Tables 2.11.1 What Are You Practicing? In this section, you’ll strengthen your ability to read and interpret visual and tabular representations of functions. In environmental science, data is often collected and communicated through graphs and tables, so being fluent in interpreting these is essential. 2.11.2 How to Approach These Problems When working with graphs or tables, try answering: What trend do you see? Is the function increasing, decreasing, leveling off, or fluctuating? What do the axes and labels tell you? What units are being used? What do the variables represent? Can you predict values not directly shown? Can you estimate an in-between value? Can you guess the shape of the full function? 2.11.3 Practice Problems Use reasoning and estimation to explore these problems. Think in terms of shape and behavior before trying to be exact.  Level 1: Getting Comfortable 1. Here is a table showing the number of insects counted in a trap each day: Day Insects 0 10 1 14 2 19 3 25 4 32 a.

In this section, you’ll practice translating real-world environmental scenarios into mathematical functions. This skill is key to modeling — the process of using math to represent relationships between variables like time, temperature, and elevation. You’ll learn how to: Identify input and output variables Write clear, meaningful function names Move between verbal descriptions, tables, graphs, and equations 2.12.2 How to Approach These Problems When you’re given a word problem, follow these steps: Identify what’s changing Is the input time? Distance? Elevation? Define your variables Choose names that make sense — like \\(G(t)\\) for glacier thickness or \\(T(h)\\) for temperature at elevation. Look for rates or starting values Most real-world functions are built from a starting point and a rate of change. Build the equation Most problems can be written as: \\[ \\text{Output} = \\text{Starting Value} \\pm \\text{Rate} \\cdot \\text{Input} \\] Example A glacier melts by 1.2 meters per year. It is currently 120 meters thick. a. Write a function \\(G(t)\\) to model the glacier thickness \\(t\\) years from now. b. How thick will the glacier be in 10 years?

We will be using Poll everywhere Ask questions – but please be respectful of all voices and views - wrong answers have more value than right ones! 3.2 Why are you here? Discussion In small groups: Introduce yourselves Why are you all here? What do you think this class could be useful for? What do you notice about the declared majors in this class? 3.3 What is Calculus? Discussion What do you see in this graph? 3.4 My Expectations of You Objective 1 : The ability to apply calculus to the natural system Calculus is a language that allows us to tell complex environmental stories Objective 2: Effort The best definition of I have come across the struggle to continue against a mounting desire to stop - Alex Hutchinson, Endure 3.5 Your Expectations of Me Discussion In a small group make 2 lists What can you come to see me about? What should you find someone else for? 3.6 Syllabus Highlights 3.6.1 Assessments Preparation and Participation [20%] Before class readings/questions In-class activities After-class self checks Homeworks [10%] Roughly every week Revise and resubmit Grade on accuracy and effort Tests [60%] 4 Tests over the term 2 can be re-taken during finals week 1 pg of notes (2sides) Project [10%] Low stakes group project applying the big picture concepts of this class Focuses on reading and interpreting the math Class discussion Why do you think there is so much weight on tests and participation? 3.6.2 Acedemic Integrity This class has been designed to reward you for doing your own work Tests will be relatively straightforward if you make the effort on the in-class and homework assessments Using these resources will only make studying for tests harder. Many of these resources give you the illusion of understanding - but the reality is quite different. 3.6.3 Late Assessment / Missed Assessment Policy This is a firm policy to make sure I am being fair to all of you. Grace period: Homeworks for this class are due Friday at 11:59pm. Homeworks will be accepted 72 hrs after their due date with no penalty (Monday 11:59pm). Graded work not turned in by this time will receive a grade of zero. Missed Tests: If you miss a test, you will need to use one of your ‘re-takes’ during finals weeks to do it. However, if you have a legitimate reason, I will work with you to reschedule the test earlier so you can save your re-take. Missed Class Preparation/Participation: From time to time we miss class for several reasons (studying for another test that day, field work, illness, etc). There will be no opportunity to submit preparation and participation activities if they are missed. The purpose of these activities are to reinforce concepts in the moment – and have little value out the context of the material being covered that day. To accommodate for this, 5% of the total preparation and participation assessments will be dropped. There will also be additional extra-credit opportunities throughout the term. Exceptional Circumstances: You must contact me 48 hours before the actual due date (not after the 48hr grace period) of a graded assignment to give me advanced notice, or within 12 hours after the work is due in the case of an emergency. If you fail to do this, you will receive zero credit for the missed assignment. Class Discussion What do we consider exceptional circumstances? 3.6.4 Test Retakes Policy There is no Final in this class – BUT – I will use the finals timeslot for the retakes. So don’t plan an early break if you think you might be doing a retake. If you miss a test during the term for a valid reason (health, emergency etc) and inform me in a timely manner, I’ll schedule a time during office hours for you to take the test. This flexibility is only good for a couple of days as I want to get the graded tests back to the rest of the class. If you miss a test for another reason (slept in, went to a wedding etc) you can always use one of your retakes – that’s what they are for. Reasons to retake Missed a test Want to try for a better grade Love calc so much you want to do more problems You can retake upto 2 tests. Your best score counts – so no risk 3.6.5 Office Hours Please select ALL times that could work. I will always try to hang around for 30mins or so after class to answer any questions. Office hours will be posted on Canvas as soon as they are set. 3.6.6 Class notes All notes that I take in class are available on the onenote notebook link on Canvas All lectures will be recorded - these will also be made available on Canvas From time to time the technology will fail us. Remember these are being provided as a bonus. There is no substitute for attending class and taking your own notes. 3.7 Questions? Class discussion Ask me anything - whats on your mind - need clarification on any of the things we’ve talked about? 3.8 Paper Planes Paper Plane Activity We are going to make paper planes and then see how well they fly. We are going to break into 4 groups: Group 1: Instructions not included – I know how to make a paper plane already Group 2: Notes - Watch the video multiple times, pausing and taking notes – I’m confident I can make a good plane Group 3: Team – Work together and make 1 TEAM plane. Group 4: Solo first + then team up - Make your own plane, then make a team plane Discussion Why did we make paper planes in calc? 3.9 Rate of Change - A First Look Class Discussion When we try to understand derivatives, the most common place to start is Position-&gt;Velocity-&gt;Acceleration and how they are linked. Lets have a look at this while watching Usain Bolt run the 100m in 9.69s While we watch this video I want you to keep in mind the idea of change - what variables are changing as we move through this race. Usain Bolt 100m Record Group Discussion How fast did he run? Can you calculate it? What was the fastest he ran? OR what was his top speed (velocity)? When do you think this happened? 3)The time it took him to get to 10m markers was measured, and the plot is below. What does this tell us about how fast he ran? 4)If we fit a smooth curve to this path, instead of looking at the slope over every 10m, we can look at the instantaneous rate of change or the derivative at any point. Note: The reason the curve needs to be smooth will be covered later - this is all just a preview No if we calculate the instantaneous rate of change and plot it against time - we get the velocity vs time relationship. Using this - try to describe how is velocity (speed) varied during the race. The world wondered how fast he could actually run the 100m. A year later at the world championships sensors were places along the tract to capture in high resolution his position with time. What do you notice this time? What is causing the oscillating in the red line?

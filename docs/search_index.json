Welcome to Calculus for Environmental Science.  This book is your companion for exploring the natural world through the lens of calculus—especially the powerful ideas of change and accumulation. You’ll find that calculus is not just about symbols on a page—it’s about asking meaningful questions, interpreting patterns, and making sense of complex environmental systems. And along the way, you’ll see that you are absolutely capable of mastering these ideas. 1.1 Why This Book? Most calculus textbooks lean heavily on physics examples—motion, velocity, and acceleration—because calculus was originally developed to solve physics problems. Those examples are powerful, and we’ll use them from time to time because they give us an intuitive “feel” for how change works. But today, calculus is a tool used across many disciplines: biology, ecology, environmental science, economics, engineering, and beyond. In this book, we’ll focus on examples that resonate with your studies and your interests as an environmental scientist. Environmental scientists face some of the most urgent and complex challenges of our time—climate change, biodiversity loss, resource management, and pollution. Calculus gives us tools to: Predict how systems evolve over time Estimate impacts and risks Model natural and human systems with differential equations Analyze rates of change and long-term accumulation Throughout this book, you’ll work with real environmental data, use visual and conceptual approaches, and practice skills that matter for sustainability. Our goal is not just to “get through calculus,” but to see how these mathematical ideas open doors for discovery and problem-solving in the real world. 1.2 What Is Calculus? At its heart, calculus is the mathematics of change and accumulation. These two ideas are everywhere in science: The rate of CO₂ increase in the atmosphere is a derivative. The total added CO₂ over a year is an integral. Traditionally, calculus is first introduced through physics examples like velocity (rate of change of position) and acceleration (rate of change of velocity). These are helpful because most of us can feel what it means to move faster or slower. We’ll use those examples when they make ideas clearer. But throughout this book, our main goal is to connect calculus directly to the environment you are studying. You’ll see derivatives and integrals applied to population growth, forest carbon storage, water flow in rivers, and other natural systems. We’ll build your understanding of these concepts step by step, supported by graphs, data, and hands-on examples. And if it’s been a while since your last math class, that’s completely okay—you’ll find plenty of support here. We’ll meet you where you are and grow your skills together. Change is Everywhere In a small group, discuss where change could be happening in this image? 1.3 How This Book Works Each chapter is designed to support you as a learner. You’ll find: Clear explanations of key concepts Environmental examples to connect math with meaning Practice problems to strengthen your skills Reflection prompts to help you think about what you’re learning 1.4 Success in This Class First and foremost, know this: we believe in your ability to learn and grow. You bring unique strengths and perspectives, and your effort matters here. Mistakes are not a setback—they are the very heart of learning. When you get something wrong, you uncover where your thinking needs refinement, and that creates the space for real growth. Struggle is not a sign you don’t belong; it’s proof that your brain is stretching and building new connections. Just like in science, learning calculus is about iteration—trying, testing, revising, and improving. That process is what makes your understanding deeper and more durable. Assessments in this class are snapshots of your thinking at a particular moment in time. They are not final judgments about your intelligence, your worth, or your potential. You will have chances to revisit concepts, refine your understanding, and demonstrate what you’ve learned. Growth comes from re-engaging with the material, not from perfection on the first try. So give yourself permission to be imperfect. Keep engaging, reflecting, and asking questions. We’ll be here to support you every step of the way. 1.5 Looking Ahead By the end of this course, you will be able to: Apply calculus concepts to natural systems Analyze environmental data with confidence Interpret and communicate your results to others But even more important than any specific skill, you’ll leave this course with a stronger belief in your ability to learn mathematics. Calculus is not just a hurdle to clear—it’s a tool that expands how you see and understand the world. Our hope is that by connecting it to the environment you care about, you’ll discover both its usefulness and its beauty. Most importantly, you’ll leave with the confidence to keep growing—using mathematics as a tool to explore, protect, and better understand the natural world around you. 1.6 ⚠️ A Big Disclaimer ⚠️ I started writing this textbook to create a calculus resource that speaks directly to your interests as environmental scientists. My goal is to make calculus feel relevant, supportive, and connected to the systems you care about. That said, this is very much a work in progress. This draft will have typos, rough edges, and the occasional mistake. But here’s the good news: it’s also free.  If you come across an error—big or small—please let me know so I can fix it for you and for future students. Your feedback is not just welcome, it’s essential to making this a better resource. Thanks for your patience, your sharp eyes, and your willingness to learn from (and with) an evolving text. Together, we’ll keep improving it.

Track units through computations and check results for reasonableness. Build and evaluate a simple model for an environmental variable as a function of time and elevation. It may have been a while since you last used some of your pre-calculus knowledge. Don’t worry if certain topics feel unfamiliar—we’ll walk through each concept with context and practice. This chapter is designed to help you review and refresh the foundational math skills that will support your success in this course. Think of it as a toolbox: later chapters will point to specific tools you’ll need to solve real problems, and those are the ideal moments to revisit them. Concepts stick best when learned in context—so come back to this chapter anytime you need a quick refresher. 2.2 What You’re Expected to Know To get the most out of this course, you should feel reasonably comfortable with: Working with functions and interpreting graphs Manipulating algebraic equations Rules for exponents and logarithms Understanding and converting units Reading and setting up word problems If these topics feel rusty, that’s perfectly normal. This chapter is here to get you back up to speed—and to remind you that you already have more tools than you might think. 2.3 How to Approach Calculus Problems Understanding calculus isn’t about memorizing steps—it’s about learning to think mathematically so you can interpret real-world change. It’s normal for parts of this to feel unfamiliar at first; progress comes from trying, checking, and revising. In this course, we’ll model environmental systems—temperature, rainfall, population dynamics—and the goal is clarity, not perfection on the first attempt. When you get stuck, start small: sketch the situation, label axes and units, compute one example value, and say out loud what a slope or an area means in context. Treat mistakes as information, not judgment—they show you what to try next. Keep going; you’re building tools you’ll use well beyond this class. Here’s a strategy to help you become a more confident problem solver: 2.3.1 Clarify the Ask What is being asked? Is the question about a rate of change, a maximum/minimum, or an accumulated quantity? What type of function or scenario is involved (linear, quadratic, exponential, etc.)? Always start by identifying what quantities are changing and how they’re related. 2.3.2 List the Givens Write down the given information clearly. Label all variables, units, and known values. If a graph or context is given, sketch or summarize what you see. Clarity in setup is half the solution. 2.3.3 Translate the Math Equations are not just symbols—they are instructions: Each term contributes to the behavior of the function. Operators (+, −, ×, ÷, …) tell you what actions to take. Derivatives tell you how the function is changing. Don’t rush through the algebra. Pause and ask: “What is this term telling me?” 2.3.4 Work Step by Step Instead of aiming straight for the final answer, focus on the process: Write out what you’re doing and why. If you take a derivative, explain what it represents (e.g., “This is the rate of change of population over time.”) Label your steps so they can be traced logically. When taking notes, don’t just copy answers. Write procedures and reasoning—this builds transferable understanding. 2.3.5 Reflect and Interpret Does your answer make sense in context? Are the units correct? Is the magnitude reasonable? What does your result say about the system you’re studying? In environmental science, the interpretation is as important as the calculation. 2.3.6 Growth Mindset You may not see math in every class you take—that’s okay. Our goal here is to build confidence and numerical literacy. Solving math problems is a step-by-step process. Thinking too far ahead can cause confusion. Take it one step at a time—that’s how you make progress. Also, try not to overthink mid-solution. If you tried to narrate every muscle movement while climbing stairs, you might trip. Trust yourself. Don’t second-guess every step—work through to the end. When you reflect, you’ll catch errors and sharpen your thinking. Confidence grows by doing. Keep moving forward—even imperfect progress builds understanding. Athletes know this: when you overanalyze your swing while swinging, performance often gets worse. Much of skilled work is partly automatic. Bringing every detail into the conscious mind can interrupt your flow. Trust your instincts. Don’t be afraid to commit to your approach. Swing through—you’ll learn more by finishing a solution than by freezing in doubt. 2.4 How We Communicate Relationships By thinking of functions as input-output machines and visualizing them on a graph, you’ll be better equipped to interpret and model relationships in environmental systems and beyond. A function represents a relationship between two quantities: an input and an output. The way we represent and communicate this is through: Verbal descriptions Graphical representations like charts Tables of data Formulas that capture the relationship Your Turn In a small group describe how the air temperature has changed in the last 24 hours. Write a statement describing the air temperature Graphically represent your description Create a table that represents your discussion Attempt to write an equation Now discuss the pros and cons of each of the methods. Discuss what you can and can’t do with each description of the temperature and time relationship. Discussion Prompt How does air temperature change with elevation as you hike up a mountain? Can we describe that change with a function? As you move upward through the atmosphere, the temperature typically drops at a fairly predictable rate. This is called the adiabatic lapse rate, which averages around 6.5°C per 1000 meters (or about 1°C per 154 meters). You’ll use this rule to model how the temperature changes from Seattle (sea level) to the summit of Mount Rainier (4392 m). Assume the temperature at sea level in Seattle is 18°C. Let’s use our approach to problem solving: What is the ask? What are we given? Translate the Math &amp; Work step-by-step We can translate this word problem into a table. Use the lapse rate to compute the temperature at the following elevations: Elevation (m) Temperature (°C) 0 (Seattle) 1000 2000 3000 4000 We could visualize this data by plotting these points on a graph Use R or graph paper to create a quick sketch of the temperature vs. elevation relationship. Figure 2.1: Air temperature (degC) as a function of time (hours) Finally we could attempt to write a function Use the pattern in the data to define a linear function that models temperature as a function of elevation. Let: \\(T(h)\\) = temperature at elevation \\(h\\) (in meters) Assume \\(T(0) = 18\\) and use the lapse rate to define the slope \\(T(h) =\\) Reflect and Interpret Does you answer make sense? Does it pass the sniff test? Is that what you observe when you go hiking? What does the slope of your function represent? What temperature do you predict at 4392 meters (Mount Rainier’s summit)? 2.5 Functions and Their Representations In the last activity we wrote a simple function. Now let’s take a step back and make sure we understand what functions mean and how they work. 2.5.1 Understanding What \\(f(x)\\) Means You’ve probably seen the equation of a line written like this: \\[ y = mx + b \\] This is the same as writing: \\[ f(x) = mx + b \\] Both notations describe the same relationship. Here’s what they mean: \\(x\\) is the input (what you plug into the function). \\(f(x)\\) or \\(y\\) is the output (what comes out after applying the function rule). Graphically: The input is usually plotted along the x-axis. The output (\\(y\\) or \\(f(x)\\)) is plotted along the y-axis. So when you see a point like \\((4, 11)\\), it means: Input \\(x = 4\\) produces output \\(f(x) = 11\\). A function is like a black box: you put something in, a rule is applied, and you get something out. For example: \\[ f(x) = 2x + 3 \\] If we input \\(x = 4\\): \\[ f(4) = 2 \\cdot 4 + 3 = 11 \\] So the point \\((4, 11)\\) would appear on the graph. Input: \\(x = 4\\) Rule: multiply by 2, then add 3 Output: \\(f(4) = 11\\) 2.5.2 Functions Don’t Have to Be Named \\(f\\) Functions can be named in ways that make their meaning clearer. For example: \\(T(t)\\) for temperature as a function of time \\(P(n)\\) for population as a function of years The variable also doesn’t always have to be \\(x\\). Choosing names that match the context makes your math easier to read, easier to explain, and easier to connect to the real world. 2.5.2.1 Why Meaningful Function Names Matter Suppose we want to model how land temperature T (in °C) changes with distance d (in km) from the shore. We could write the function in a very generic way: \\[ f(x) = 0.2x + 3 \\] Here, f is the temperature and x is the distance. This works mathematically, but it doesn’t tell us much about what the variables mean. A clearer way is to use variables that match the context: \\[ T(d) = 0.2d + 3 \\] Now the function communicates something immediately: \\(T(d)\\) = land temperature (°C) \\(d\\) = distance from the coast (km) This version is not only valid but more meaningful: “Temperature increases by 0.2°C for every kilometer inland, starting from 3°C at the coast.” By naming functions and variables in ways that reflect the system being studied, we make the math easier to interpret, easier to explain, and easier to apply. 2.5.3 Functions Can Have More Than One Input \\(\\, f(x,y)\\) Many environmental processes depend on more than one variable. For example, the distribution of a terrestrial species might be best described as a function of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), where \\(x\\) is longitude and \\(y\\) is latitude. Thinking further: what would the function look like for the location of a species in three dimensions, such as mapping their position in a water column? How would you write this mathematically? In reality, many environmental systems depend on far more than three variables. When building models, the art is in simplifying: choosing the key variables that matter most for the question at hand. Including every possible factor would be too complex to work with, so we focus on what’s essential. Discussion Prompt In a group discuss the factors that control the growth of a tree. Write a pseudo-equation that takes the form of \\[ \\text{Growth} = f(\\text{Variable 1}, \\text{Variable 2}, \\ldots) \\] How many variables drive the growth of a tree? Activity: Modeling Temperature as a Function of Time and Elevation Learning Goals Understand how to construct and interpret a function of two variables. Apply environmental context to multivariable functions. Visualize how elevation impacts the daily temperature cycle using lapse rate. At sea level, the temperature throughout the day is modeled by: \\(T(t) = 10 - 5 \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) [°C]\\) Temperature decreases with elevation, at a lapse rate of 6.5°C per 1000 meters: \\(L= \\frac{6.5}{1000} = 0.0065 [\\frac{°C}{m}]\\) The temperature as a function of elevation alone (assuming sea level temperature is 10°C): \\(T(h) = 10 - 0.0065 \\cdot h\\) So the temperature as a function of both time t and elevation h is: \\(T(t, h) = 10 - 5 \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) - 0.0065 \\cdot h\\) ## time elevation temperature ## 1 6 0 10.00 ## 2 6 500 6.75 ## 3 6 1500 0.25 ## 4 12 0 15.00 ## 5 12 1000 8.50 ## 6 18 2000 -3.00 ## 7 18 5000 -22.50 Reflection: At what time of day is the temperature difference between sea level and 2000 m greatest? What happens to the daily temperature range as elevation increases? Does the timing of the warmest part of the day change with elevation? Stare at this equation T(t, h) = 10 - 5 * cos(pi * t / 12) - 0.0065 * h, can you visualize the impact of t? what about h? The equation could have been written as f(x, y) = 10 - 5 * cos(pi * x / 12) - 0.0065 * y, would this be harder to interpret? Figure 2.2: Apply the function to compute temperature 2.6 Graphing and Interpreting Change Understanding the shape of a graph is crucial for interpreting real-world phenomena. Here are key features to notice: Increasing/Decreasing: Is the function going up or down as \\(x\\) increases? Peaks and Valleys: Where are the local maxima and minima? Concavity: Does the curve bend upward (concave up) or downward (concave down)? Let’s look at an example of a quadratic function, which is commonly used to model situations with a single peak or valley. This function is an increasing function for \\(x&lt;2\\) and decreasing for \\(x&gt;2\\). It has a maximum at \\(x=2\\). We can also notice that the concavity of the function is concave down. We can also look at the how the function is changing as we move along the x axis. At \\(x=2\\) the slope of the function is positive and steep. As we approach the maximum, the slope of the function is still positive, but its not increasing as fast. We could say its increasing at a decreasing rate. At the peak, the function is not longer changing. Now as we pass \\(x=2\\) the function is decreasing slowly at first, but faster and faster as \\(x\\) gets further away from the peak. You can think of this as a ball in your hand. You throw it up, initially its moving fast, but as gravity acts on the ball it slows. Then for an instance, the ball hangs in the air - this is where it reaches its peak. Then the ball starts to fall, slowly at first, but it then begins to fall faster and faster. The calculus you will learn in this course will give you the tools needed to quatify these observations. Identify the rates of change at different point and find the maximas and minimas. 2.7 Key Function Types Here are five common functions you’ll encounter: Function Type Form Environmental Example Linear \\(y = mx + b\\) Streamflow increasing over time Quadratic \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) Pollution dispersal from a point source Exponential \\(y = a \\cdot b^x\\) Invasive species growth Logarithmic \\(y = \\log(x)\\) pH or sound intensity Mini Exercise Match the following environmental situations with function types: 1. Forest biomass grows rapidly, then levels off. 2. A spill’s impact decreases as you move downstream. 3. A steady rise in sea level over time. Discussion Prompt What environmental processes could you model with these functions. See if you can identify some additional real-world examples for each graph. Sketch the rough shapes of these functions and identify some of their key features? 2.8 Units, Rates, and Word Problems Units are a scientist’s best friend. They don’t just tell us what we’re measuring—they also help us check if our answers make sense. In calculus, units play a central role because they give meaning to rates of change (derivatives) and accumulations (integrals). Here are some common examples in environmental science: Atmospheric CO₂ concentration is measured in ppm (parts per million). Rainfall might be reported in mm/hour. Streamflow can be given in m³/s (cubic meters per second). Tree growth might be in cm/year. 2.8.1 Why Units Matter Think of units as guardrails for problem solving: They help you avoid mistakes (e.g., mixing meters with kilometers). They give physical meaning to abstract symbols. They allow you to compare across systems and scales. If your answer has the wrong units, it’s almost certainly the wrong answer. 2.8.1.1 A Famous Example: The Mars Orbiter Mishap  In 1999, NASA lost the Mars Climate Orbiter, a spacecraft that cost $390 million to design, build, and launch—all because of a simple unit conversion error. One engineering team used English units (pound-seconds of force). Another team assumed metric units (Newton-seconds). The mismatch went unnoticed, and the spacecraft’s trajectory was off course. The result: the orbiter entered Mars’ atmosphere at the wrong altitude and was destroyed. This dramatic example shows why scientists and engineers obsess over units. While our classroom mistakes won’t crash a $390 million spacecraft, they can still derail your reasoning. Keeping track of units is one of the simplest—and most powerful—ways to check your work. Activity: Average Rate of Change Suppose atmospheric CO₂ increases from 400 ppm to 420 ppm over 5 years. Calculate the average rate of change Now repeat the procee but this time no numbers, run the same calculation with just the units. What do you end up with? Now tell me the sotry of what your calculation means? Reflection Questions What if we reported the time in months instead of years? How would the rate change? What if the increase had been 400 → 420 ppm in 10 years — what happens to the rate? Does “average rate” mean CO₂ increased by exactly 4 ppm every year? Why or why not? 2.8.2 Key Idea A rate of change always involves comparing how much one quantity changes relative to another. \\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Change in Output}}{\\text{Change in Input}} \\] If the input is time, the rate tells us “how fast” something changes. If the input is distance, the rate might describe a gradient (e.g., temperature lapse rate with elevation). If the input is volume, the rate might describe a concentration per unit volume. Units don’t just check your work—they tell the story of what the math means. 2.9 Getting Comfortable with Word Problems Environmental word problems are at the heart of applying calculus. They take a real-world situation and ask you to identify the quantities involved, describe how they are changing, and build a model that captures those changes. When you read a word problem, pause and ask yourself: What is changing? (What’s the variable of interest?) How fast is it changing? (Are we talking about a rate or an accumulated total?) What influences that change? (Is it driven by time, distance, elevation, or something else?) 2.9.1 Why Word Problems Matter Anyone can compute a derivative or an integral once the equation is written down. The real challenge—and the real skill—is translating words into math. That’s what lets you use calculus to model glaciers, forests, rivers, or populations. Remember: there is no single “right” way to start. Sketching, making a table, or writing down what you know in words are all valid first steps. 2.9.2 Example Problem A glacier is melting at a rate that increases each year. What mathematical tools would help you model this? Step 1. What’s changing? The glacier’s thickness or volume is decreasing. Step 2. How is it changing? The rate of melt is itself increasing over time. That means the rate is not constant. Step 3. What tools do we need? A derivative describes the melt rate at a given moment. An integral (this is a preview of 292) could estimate the total ice lost over a span of years. Because the rate is changing, an exponential or quadratic function might be a better fit than a linear one. Activity: Rate of change around us What other environmental situations involve a rate that changes over time (not just a constant rate)? Discuss and share back with the class How would you represent this glacier problem with a graph? With a table? If you only had measurements of ice thickness each year, how would you estimate the rate of change? 2.9.3 Key Idea Word problems are really about translation. You’re moving between: Verbal description → “the glacier is melting faster each year” Mathematical model → equations that capture this trend Interpretation → what the math tells us about the glacier and its future The math is the language, but the story is always about the system you’re studying. 2.10 Practice: Interpreting Functions 2.10.1 What Are You Practicing? In this section, you’ll get more comfortable reading, interpreting, and evaluating functions — especially those that model environmental systems. You’ll see functions written in different forms (formulas, graphs, tables), and you’ll practice thinking about what the input and output represent. This is an important foundation for calculus. When we interpret derivatives later on, we’ll always come back to what is this function telling us about the real world? 2.10.2 How to Approach These Problems For any function, try answering these three questions: What are the input(s) and output? What does the function take in, and what does it give back? What do the variables represent? For example, is \\(t\\) time? Is \\(T(t)\\) a temperature? What are the units? What does the formula tell you about the relationship? If the function is increasing or decreasing, by how much? Are there any constants or slopes that describe rates? 2.10.3 Practice Problems Try these on your own or with a partner. Don’t just plug in numbers — ask what the function is saying!

What might the graph of this function look like? c. What does it suggest about the plant’s growth? d. If you were to plug in a (very) large value for t what happens? Does the result make sense? How could you restrict this function? 6. A temperature function is defined as: \\(T(h) = 15 - 0.0065h\\), where \\(h\\) is elevation in meters above sea level. a. What is the temperature at sea level? b. How much does the temperature drop every 1000 meters? c. At what elevation will the temperature be 0°C?  Level 3: Challenging Interpretation 7. A water tank is being filled and drained at the same time. The volume of water is modeled by: \\(V(t) = 100 + 30t - 2t^2\\), where \\(V\\) is volume in liters and \\(t\\) is time in minutes. a. What kind of function is this? b. Looking at the expressions, can you explain what each term might be doing? c. Explain What happens to the volume over time?

What happens when \\(x = 0\\)? c. What happens as \\(x \\to \\infty\\)? What does that mean in context? 9.

[Hint: try putting this into DESMOS to visualize] 2.11 Practice: Reading Graphs &amp; Tables 2.11.1 What Are You Practicing? In this section, you’ll strengthen your ability to read and interpret visual and tabular representations of functions. In environmental science, data is often collected and communicated through graphs and tables, so being fluent in interpreting these is essential. 2.11.2 How to Approach These Problems When working with graphs or tables, try answering: What trend do you see? Is the function increasing, decreasing, leveling off, or fluctuating? What do the axes and labels tell you? What units are being used? What do the variables represent? Can you predict values not directly shown? Can you estimate an in-between value? Can you guess the shape of the full function? 2.11.3 Practice Problems Use reasoning and estimation to explore these problems. Think in terms of shape and behavior before trying to be exact.  Level 1: Getting Comfortable 1. Here is a table showing the number of insects counted in a trap each day: Day Insects 0 10 1 14 2 19 3 25 4 32 a.

You’ll learn how to: Identify input and output variables Write clear, meaningful function names Move between verbal descriptions, tables, graphs, and equations 2.12.2 How to Approach These Problems When you’re given a word problem, follow these steps: Identify what’s changing Is the input time? Distance? Elevation? Define your variables Choose names that make sense — like \\(G(t)\\) for glacier thickness or \\(T(h)\\) for temperature at elevation. Look for rates or starting values Most real-world functions are built from a starting point and a rate of change. Build the equation Most problems can be written as: \\[ \\text{Output} = \\text{Starting Value} \\pm \\text{Rate} \\cdot \\text{Input} \\] Example A glacier melts by 1.2 meters per year.

Interpret the meaning of a derivative from graphs, data, and equations. Apply derivative notation and connect it to environmental contexts. Solve practice problems and apply derivatives to real-world examples. 3.2 Understanding The Speed Of Change Imagine you’re a marine biologist monitoring the population of a reef-dwelling fish species in a protected area. Over the past five years, the fish population has started to rebound after a ban on commercial fishing. But the key question isn’t just how many fish are there now?—it’s how fast is the population recovering? Or picture a team of conservationists tracking the spread of an invasive plant through a national park. The plant’s total coverage increases each month—but is that rate speeding up, slowing down, or holding steady? These are not just ecological observations. They’re questions about change. And answering them requires calculus. 3.3 Why We Need New Math Tools Environmental systems are dynamic. They change in space and time, often unpredictably. To understand them, we don’t just need to measure things—we need to describe how those things change: How fast is a species’ population growing or shrinking? At what rate is temperature increasing in alpine ecosystems? How steeply is oxygen concentration decreasing with depth in a lake? When does the tide rise the fastest? These are all examples of rates of change, and they are the foundation of the derivative. 3.4 What You’ll Learn in This Chapter In this chapter, you’ll build your intuition for what a derivative represents. We’ll explore: The difference between average and instantaneous change How to interpret a derivative from a graph Real examples where rates of change matter The mathematical notation that lets us describe and work with change You’ll also work with data—like fish populations, temperature profiles, and environmental time series—to see how derivatives emerge from patterns and graphs. By the end of the chapter, you’ll be able to look at a system and say not just what is happening, but how fast is it happening—and in which direction? That’s the power of the derivative. 3.5 What Is A Derivative? You’ve probably seen derivatives before—even if you didn’t call them that. If you’ve ever looked at how fast something was growing, declining, or shifting in space or time, you’ve already been thinking about derivatives. Table 3.1: Terms Across Disciplines That Represent Derivatives Math…Physics…Data…Context Environmental…Applied…Context Rate of change Growth rate Slope of the tangent line Decay rate Instantaneous rate Reaction rate Velocity Flux Acceleration Turnover rate Gradient Loss rate / Gain rate Marginal change Change per unit time Slope at a point Response rate Rise over run Uptake rate Delta Y / Delta X First difference Mathematically, the derivative describes the instantaneous rate of change—the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a given point. 3.5.1 Derivative Notation: Speaking the Language of Change In calculus, there are several common notations used to represent the derivative—the instantaneous rate of change of a function. Understanding these notations is key to reading and writing mathematics fluently, especially when interpreting real-world problems in environmental science. 3.5.1.1 Common Derivative Notations Let’s say we have a function, we could right this as: \\[ f(x) = something\\ with\\ x&#39;s \\ in\\ it \\\\ y= something\\ with\\ x&#39;s \\ in\\ it \\] We can then write the notation of the derivative with respect to \\(x\\) in several ways, all of which mean exactly the same thing: Notation Spoken As Description \\(f&#39;(x)\\) “f prime of x” Most compact form; often used in textbooks \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) “dee y over dee x” Emphasizes that \\(y\\) is a function of \\(x\\); Leibniz notation \\(\\frac{d}{dx} f(x)\\) “dee by dee x of f of x” Shows that differentiation is an operation \\(D_x f(x)\\) “D sub x of f of x” Operator form used in some texts \\(y&#39;\\) “y prime” Used when \\(y = f(x)\\), common in applied settings Prime notation: e.g., \\(f&#39;(x)\\), \\(g&#39;(t)\\) Leibniz notation: e.g., \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\), \\(\\frac{d}{dt}\\) Operator notation: e.g., \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(f(x))\\), applying \\(\\frac{d}{dt}\\) to an expression 3.5.1.2 The Derivative as an Operator The notation \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\) is not just a symbol—it’s an operator. That means it acts on a function to produce another function: the derivative. Think of it this way: The symbol \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\) is a command: “Take the derivative of whatever comes after this with respect to \\(x\\).” So if you write: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(3x^2 + 2x\\right) \\] You are instructing the reader (or yourself!) to differentiate the expression \\(3x^2 + 2x\\) with respect to \\(x\\). The result: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(3x^2 + 2x\\right) = 6x + 2 \\] 3.6 Average Rate of Change Discussion Prompt Think about a population of salmon in a river system. Suppose the number of salmon increases steadily over a migration season. How could we describe how fast the population is changing? The average rate of change of a quantity tells us how much that quantity changes per unit of time (or distance, or any other input variable). It’s a way to summarize how something is increasing or decreasing over an interval, even if the actual change isn’t perfectly steady throughout. Mathematically, the average rate of change of a function \\(f(x)\\) between two points \\(x = a\\) and \\(x = b\\) is: \\[ \\text{Average Rate of Change} = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} \\] This is the rise over run formula you’ve likely used in algebra. It gives us the slope of the secant line connecting the two points on a graph. 3.6.1 Environmental Example: Ocean Temperature Let’s say ocean surface temperature is modeled by a function \\(T(t)\\), where \\(t\\) is time in months and \\(T(t)\\) is the temperature in degrees Celsius. Suppose: In June (\\(t = 6\\)), the temperature is \\(T(6) = 13^\\circ C\\) In September (\\(t = 9\\)), the temperature is \\(T(9) = 16^\\circ C\\) The average rate of temperature change from June to September is: \\[ \\frac{T(9) - T(6)}{9 - 6} = \\frac{16 - 13}{3} = 1^\\circ C \\text{ per month} \\] Interpretation: On average, the ocean surface temperature increased by 1°C per month during this time. 3.6.2 More Examples from Environmental Science Goal: Practice identifying real-world situations where average rate of change is meaningful. Step 1: Review Examples Together Here are some examples of average rate of change in environmental contexts: Carbon Emissions: Change in CO₂ levels over decades.

What does that suggest about the acceleration of sea level rise? Connect to Derivatives If this were a smooth function \\(S(t)\\) representing sea level at year \\(t\\), what would the derivative \\(S&#39;(t)\\) represent? What would a plot of the average rate of change look like? What would happen if we looked at the average rate of change over shorter and shorter periods? How would this chang the way a plot of the rate of change look like? Reflection Prompt Describe a situation in your area of interest (marine biology, forestry, climate science, etc.) where an average rate of change is used. What does it tell you, and what might it leave out? 3.7 Instantaneous Rate of Change: Zooming In In the last section, you estimated the average rate of sea level rise over several 5-year periods. But what if we want to know how fast sea level was rising at one specific moment—say, in the year 2010? That’s where the instantaneous rate of change comes in. It answers the question: How fast is something changing right now? This is the essence of what we mean by the derivative in calculus. 3.7.1 From Averages to Instants Think back to the graph of sea level rise: The average rate over a time interval is the slope of a secant line connecting two points. The instantaneous rate at a single point is the slope of the tangent line at that point. You can imagine drawing shorter and shorter secant lines—where the two points move closer together. As the interval shrinks, the slope of the secant approaches the slope of the tangent. This limiting process—zooming in on a curve until the “average” becomes the “instant”—is the central idea of the derivative. 3.7.2 Environmental Meaning In sea level terms, the instantaneous rate tells us: How fast sea level is rising at a specific year (e.g., 2010). Whether that rate is speeding up (acceleration) or slowing down. Similar questions appear across environmental science: How fast is a glacier front retreating today? How quickly is a species’ population growing right now compared to 10 years ago? What is the current rate of deforestation in a region? Understanding these instantaneous rates of change allows scientists to: Model dynamic systems more accurately. Make predictions about future change. Take action at the moments when it matters most. 3.7.3 Activity: Environmental Meaning of Instantaneous Change Goal: Connect the mathematical idea of instantaneous rate of change to an animal’s life history — and begin to think about how that rate itself can change. Step 1: Predict Together (2 minutes) Imagine tracking the weight of a bear over its entire lifetime. Sketch or imagine what you think the weight vs. age graph might look like. Where do you think the curve is steepest? Flat? Could it ever slope downward? Step 2: Small Group Brainstorm (5 minutes) In groups of 2–3 discuss 1. What does the instantaneous rate of weight change represent biologically at different stages? 2. Where is the bear gaining weight faster and faster (accelerating)? 3. Where is the bear still gaining weight, but more slowly (decelerating)? 4. Why might wildlife managers care about not only the rate of change, but whether that rate itself is increasing or decreasing? Step 3: Share &amp; Compare (5 minutes) Each group shares one insight. Compare across groups: At which ages would the rate of weight gain likely be accelerating? When would it be slowing down? When might the rate even become negative? Discuss: Why does knowing the rate of change of the rate of change add more insight than the rate alone? Step 4: Individual Reflection (2 minutes) Think of another lifetime pattern in an organism: What is changing across the lifetime? At what stage is growth accelerating? At what stage is growth decelerating? What decisions or actions could this second layer of information support (e.g., timing of reproduction, monitoring health decline, conservation priorities)? 3.8 The Limit Definition of a Derivative In calculus, a limit is a tool we use to understand what happens to a function as we get closer and closer to a specific point—even if we can’t plug in that point directly. Don’t worry if limits feel abstract at first—we’ll build the idea step by step with words, graphs, and formulas. 3.8.1 Intuition Suppose you were camping on the beach next to the Pacific Ocean on the 4th of July. You may not know the exact rate of sea level change on that day, but you could estimate the average rate of change nearby—for example, by comparing the sea level on July 3rd and July 4th. A limit takes this idea even further. Instead of looking at an average over whole days, we imagine shrinking the time interval smaller and smaller—so small that the “average period” is tending toward zero. In that process, we arrive at the instantaneous rate of change: how fast sea level is changing at that exact moment. 3.8.2 Why Do We Need Limits? Environmental systems are often continuous and messy for example air temperature, pollution levels, or population growth. To explore questions such as: How fast is a glacier melting right now? What is the rate of deforestation at the edge of a forest? How quickly is sea level rising at a given year? …we need a mathematical tool that captures behavior as we “zoom in.” That tool is the limit. 3.8.3 Visual Intuition As you zoom in on a curve—say, sea level rise over time—it begins to look straight. The slope of that straight line is the instantaneous rate of change. The limit formalizes this process of zooming in infinitely close. Activity: Zooming in on a Curve Goal: Explore how zooming in around a single point makes any curve begin to look like a straight line. Step 1: Observe the Panels (2 minutes) Look at the 4-panel figure: Panel 1 shows the full curve. Panels 2–4 zoom in closer and closer around a single point. Question: What changes as we zoom in? What stays the same? Step 2: Compare the Curve and the Line (5 minutes) In Panels 2–4 you see both the curve and the tangent line at the chosen point. How do the curve and tangent look different in Panel 2? By Panel 4, what do you notice about how closely the curve and the tangent overlap? Step 3: Make a Prediction (3 minutes) If we zoomed in even further (say, Panel 5, Panel 6…), what would you expect to see? Would you still be able to tell the difference between the curve and the line? Step 4: Generalize the Idea (5 minutes) Discuss in pairs or small groups: Do you think this would only work for this one curve, or for any smooth (continous) curve? What does this suggest about the nature of curves when we zoom in enough? Step 5: Reflection (2 minutes) Write down your own words to complete this sentence: When you zoom in close enough on any smooth curve, it starts to look like a ________. Takeaway: This activity shows that every smooth curve looks linear when you zoom in far enough. That’s why we use tangent lines and derivatives in calculus—to capture the local linear behavior of a curve. 3.8.4 Mathematical Notation A limit is written as: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) \\] Read aloud: “The limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\).” It asks: What value does \\(f(x)\\) get closer and closer to as \\(x\\) gets closer and closer to \\(a\\)? Notice: this may or may not equal \\(f(a)\\) or in other words, we closer to \\(a\\) but never actually get there. 3.8.5 Example: A hole in a function Let’s say we have a function below and are interested at what the value of the function is at \\(x=1\\): \\[ f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\] At first glance, if we try to plug in \\(x = 1\\), we get: \\[ f(1) = \\frac{1^2 - 1}{1 - 1} = \\frac{0}{0} \\] This is undefined! But we can still ask: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\] Factoring the numerator: \\[ \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = \\frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{x - 1} \\] As long as \\(x \\ne 1\\), the \\(x - 1\\) cancels out: \\[ f(x) = x + 1 \\] So as \\(x \\to 1\\), \\(f(x) \\to 2\\). Even though \\(f(1)\\) is undefined, the limit exists: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = 2 \\] Graphically we can see the function doesn’t exist at \\(x=1\\), which we depict as an open circle. But we can still ask, what function value do we approach as we get close to 2. 3.8.6 Estimating a limit In some cases it may not be possible to factor like the example above. So how could you get an idea of the limit. Lets introduce the idea of estimating the limit. If we write the limit again adn ask ourselves what is this mathematical statement asking: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\] If is asking, what it the value of the function as x gets closer and closer to \\(1\\). So what if we let \\(x\\) get really really close. Let x= 0.9 \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\approx \\frac{0.9^2-1}{0.9-1} \\approx \\frac{-0.19}{-0.1} \\approx 1.9 \\] Notice we are using the approximate symbol (\\(\\approx\\)) to show that we are estimating. What is we get closer still to \\(x=1\\). Let x= 0.99 \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\approx \\frac{0.99^2-1}{0.99-1} \\approx \\frac{-0.0199}{-0.01} \\approx 1.99 \\] We seem to be getting closer and close to the the value we expect. Lets get really small now. Let x= 0.999999 \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\approx \\frac{0.999999^2-1}{0.999999-1} \\approx \\frac{-0.00000199}{-0.000001} \\approx 1.999999 \\] Note: Be careful when doing this on your calculator, it is easy to forget a digit on the numerator or a denominator, and if you do your answer may be too big or too small. 3.8.7 One-Sided Limits Sometimes, its helpful to examine what is happening as we approach a point fomr both directions directios. In the previous example we apprach from the left (or the negative) side of the point. Left-hand limit: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) \\] — from values less than \\(a\\) Right-hand limit: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) \\] — from values greater than \\(a\\) You can think about this as what is the value of the function a little bit to the left and right of the point we are approaching. Extending the example above if we approached from the right \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\approx \\frac{1.000001^2-1}{1.000001-1} \\approx \\frac{0.000002000001}{0.000001} \\approx 2.000001 \\] If the left-hand and right-hand limits agree, then the overall limit exists. So in the previous example a limit exists at \\(x=1\\) and that limit is 2. \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) \\] 3.8.8 When Does a Limit Exist? For a limit to exist at a point, the function’s behavior must be predictable and consistent as we approach that point. We say: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L \\] only if all three of the following conditions are true: The Left-Hand Limit Exists \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) \\] As \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) from values less than \\(a\\), the function values must approach a real number. The Right-Hand Limit Exists \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) \\] As \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) from values greater than \\(a\\), the function values must also approach a real number. The Left- and Right-Hand Limits Are Equal \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) \\] If the two one-sided limits are not equal, the two-sided limit does not exist. 3.8.9 When a Limit Does Not Exist A limit fails to exist if any of the following happen: Type of Breakdown What Happens Jump discontinuity Left and right limits are different Infinite discontinuity One or both sides approach \\(\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\) Oscillating behavior Function fluctuates wildly near the point (e.g., \\(\\sin(1/x)\\)) 3.8.10 Environmental Example: Stream Temperature at a Dam Outlet Suppose a river’s temperature is modeled as a piecewise function: \\[ T(x) = \\begin{cases} 15, &amp; x &lt; 0 \\quad \\text{(upstream)} \\\\\\\\ 10, &amp; x &gt; 0 \\quad \\text{(downstream near a cold water dam release)} \\end{cases} \\] At \\(x = 0\\), the left-hand and right-hand limits do not match, so: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 0} T(x) \\quad \\text{does not exist} \\] This kind of jump is common in natural or engineered boundaries and reminds us that limits describe approaching behavior, not necessarily the value at a point. 3.8.11 Plot the Discontinuity 3.9 From Average to Instantaneous: The Role of Limits In environmental science, we often need to understand how fast something is changing right now — not just on average. Whether it’s the rate at which a glacier melts or how quickly CO₂ levels rise, we need a precise way to describe instantaneous change. But how do we go from a change over time (average) to a momentary change (instantaneous)? 3.9.1 Recap: Average Rate of Change We define the average rate of change of a function \\(f(t)\\) between two times \\(t=a\\) and \\(t=b\\) as: \\[ Ave = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \\] This tells us how much the function changes over the interval — for example, how much sea level rose on average over a 10-year window. To find the function values in the numerator, we would subsitute \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) into the original function \\(f(t)\\). The denominator is just the difference in time between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), or the interval we are calculating this average. Another form of this equation (which will be useful in a few sections) is achieved by doing a substitution. If we let \\(h\\) be the interval of interest. Then \\(h=b-a\\) The average equation now becomes: \\[ Ave = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{h} \\] We can go a little further and rearrange the expression for \\(h\\) in terms of \\(b\\) \\[ h=b-a \\\\ b=a+h \\] Substituting this expression for \\(b\\) into the average equaiton gives us \\[ Ave = \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] So lets think about this in words. The numerator is the difference in the function value at \\(a\\) and some value at \\(a+h\\). The denominator now just becomes the interval over which we are taking the average. We’ll get some practice with this form a little later. 3.9.2 Instantaneous Rate of Change But what if we want to know the rate of change at a single moment, like exactly at year 2020? We can’t plug \\(h = 0\\) directly into the formula — we’d be dividing by zero. Instead, we take the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\): \\[ f&#39;(t) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - f(t)}{h} \\] This is the limit definition of a derivative — and it gives us the instantaneous rate of change \\(f&#39;\\) at time \\(a\\). 3.9.3 Environmental Interpretation Let’s say we have a function \\(S(t)\\) that gives sea level (in mm) at year \\(t\\). The instantaneous rate of sea level rise at \\(t = 2020\\) is: \\[ S&#39;(2020) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{S(2020 + h) - S(2020)}{h} \\] This tells us how quickly sea level is rising at that exact year, in mm/year. 3.9.4 Visualizing the Transition Activity: From Average Change to Instantaneous Change Goal: Connect the graph of lake level changes with the equations for average rate of change (secant slope) and instantaneous rate of change (derivative). Step 1: Observe the Graphs (2 minutes) Look at the three panels: Left: secant line from 2005 to 2015 Middle: secant line from 2005 to 2010 Right: secant line from 2005 to 2006 Questions: How does the red secant line change as the interval gets smaller? How does it compare to the green tangent line? Step 2: Recall the Equations (3 minutes) Average rate of change (secant): \\[ \\frac{f(a+h) - f(x)}{h} \\] Instantaneous rate of change (derivative): \\[ \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Step 3: Explain in Your Own Words (5 minutes) With a partner, explain: What does the average rate of change represent for the lake level between 2005 and 2015? Between 2005 and 2006? How does shrinking the interval \\(h\\) change the meaning of the secant line? Why does the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\) give us the tangent line? Step 4: Environmental Meaning (5 minutes) In the context of lake levels: What does the tangent slope at 2005 represent in words? Why might scientists care about the instantaneous rate instead of just average changes over long intervals? Step 5: Reflection (2 minutes) Complete the sentence in your notes: As \\(h\\) gets smaller, the secant slope \\(\\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}\\) gets closer to the tangent slope. In my own words, this means… 3.10 Finding the Derivative Using the Limit Definition of a Derivative In this section we will use the limit definition of a derivative to find a function that represents the derivative. Let’s consider the following function: \\[ f(x) = x^2 \\] Note the function here is a function in \\(x\\) Now let’s consider the function at some point on the function where \\(x=a\\). We can re-write the limit definition of a derivative as: \\[ f&#39;(a)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Let’s now interpret what the math is telling us: \\(f&#39;(a)\\) is the derivative of the function \\(f\\) at \\(x=a\\) \\(\\lim_{h \\to 0}\\) tells us we are going to approach \\(x=a\\) but not quite get there \\(f(a+h)\\) is the function evaluation at \\(x=a+h\\) \\(f(a)\\) is the function evaluated at \\(x=a\\) Now considering these definitions, we can see that if \\(h\\) was greater than zero, this expression would be the average of the function between \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=a+h\\). However, the limit operator allows h to approach zero. If were to simply plug \\(h=0\\) into the above expression we would get \\[ f&#39;(a)=\\frac{f(a + 0) - f(a)}{0} = \\frac{0}{0} \\] If you divide anything by zero, your calculator will give you an undefined error. This is why we use the limit, it gets us really really close to zero without actually getting there. Let’s consider the derivative of the function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) and try to find the derivative at \\(x=2\\). We are in search of the derative at \\(x=2\\), this is the same as the slope of the tangent line at same point. The graph above has sketched in the tangent line. We can graphically calculate the slope of the line by looking at the rise over the run. From \\(x=1\\) to \\(x=2\\) we have a run of 1 and a rise of 4. Therefore the slope would be \\(\\frac{4}{1}=4\\). This is the derivative of this function at \\(x=2\\). We don’t always have the ability to solve derivatives graphically, so now that we know the answer we are looking for lets see if we can use the limit definition to get to the same place. \\[ f&#39;(a)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Let’s practice letting the mathematical expression tell us what to do. We know we are interested at the point \\(x=2\\) so therefore \\(a=2\\). Substituting \\(a=2\\) into the limit definition of a derivative gives us: \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(2 + h) - f(2)}{h} \\] Let’s now look at the numerator the right hand side. It tells us we are looking for the difference between the function evaulated at \\(f(2+h)\\) and \\(f(2)\\). So lets find those expressions. We were given the function as \\(f(x)=x^2\\). So to find \\(f(2+h)\\) and \\(f(2)\\) we subsitute the \\(x\\) in the original function with the points we are interested in. \\(f(2)\\) becomes: \\[ f(x)=x^2\\\\ f(2)= (2)^2=4 \\] \\(f(2+h)\\) becomes: \\[ f(x)=x^2\\\\ f(2+h)= (2+h)^2\\\\ f(2+h)= (2+h)(2+h) = h^2+4h+4 \\] Its best to expand the result so that we can manipulate the function a little easier down the road. We don’t want to substitute anything in for \\(h\\) just yet, we’ll be using the limit operator to deal with the \\(h\\) in a few steps. So now lets combine these two results to get an expression for the numerator: \\[ f(2+h)-f(2)\\\\ (h^2+4h+4)-(4)\\\\ h^2+4h \\] Lets put this back into our limit definition of a derivative: \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(2 + h) - f(2)}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+4h}{h} \\] We could now try to see what happens if we push \\(h\\) to its limit \\(h \\to 0\\): \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+4h}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(0)^2+4(0)}{0}=\\frac{0}{0} \\] This is undefined, and didn’t solve our original issue of dividing by zero. But if we look at the last expression we created, we can see that \\(h\\) could be factored out of the numerator. This would then allow the \\(h\\) in the denominator to be cancelled out. \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+4h}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h(h+4)}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (h+4)\\\\ \\] Now if we take the limit as \\(h\\) approaches zero, think of if as a extremely small number. Then we would have \\(4\\) plus a very very small number. Which is effectively \\(4\\). \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (h+4)=0+4=4 \\] We have now found the derivative of the function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) at \\(x=2\\). Or in other words the instantaneous rate of change at that point. 3.10.1 What if we wanted to find the derivative at any point? If the function is smooth and continuous (more on what this means later). Then rather than solving the definition of a function in terms of \\(a\\) we can solve it with respect to any \\(x\\). \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \\] Let’s redo the example but this time instead of \\(a=2\\) let \\(a=x\\). Let’s now look at the numerator the right hand side. It tells us we are looking for the difference between the function evaluated at \\(f(x+h)\\) and \\(f(x)\\). So lets find those expressions. We were given the function as \\(f(x)=x^2\\). So to find \\(f(x+h)\\) and \\(f(x)\\) we subsitute the \\(x\\) in the original function with the points we are interested in. \\(f(x)\\) becomes: \\[ f(x)=x^2\\\\ f(x)= (x)^2=x^2 \\] \\(f(x+h)\\) becomes: \\[ f(x)=x^2\\\\ f(x+h)= (x+h)^2\\\\ f(x+h)= (x+h)(x+h) = x^2+2xh+h^2 \\] Again, we don’t want to substitute anything in for \\(h\\) just yet. So now lets combine these two results to get an expression for the numerator: \\[ f(x+h)-f(x)\\\\ (x^2+2xh+h^2)-(x^2)\\\\ h^2+2xh \\] Lets put this back into our limit definition of a derivative: \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+2xh}{h} \\] Once again we can see that \\(h\\) could be factored out of the numerator. This would then allow the \\(h\\) in the denominator to be cancelled out. \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+2xh}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h(h+2x)}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (h+2x)\\\\ \\] Now if we take the limit as \\(h\\) approaches zero: \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (h+2x)=0+2x=2x\\\\ f&#39;(x)=2x \\] We have now found the derivative function of the function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) for all \\(x\\). Or in other words the instantaneous rate of change at any point. Note we can see if we look at \\(x=2\\), the derivative becomes 4 - which was what we got when we looked at the derivative at a point. Lets check it graphically. Using the above function, we could find the derivative of \\(f(x)=x^2\\) at \\(x=1\\). \\[ f&#39;(x)=2x\\\\ f&#39;(1)=2(1)=2 \\] Looking at the graph of the tangent at \\(x=1\\) we can calculate the slope. Using rise over run be can see that the tangent goes from \\((1,1)\\) to \\((3,5)\\), this is a rise of \\(4\\) over a run of \\(2\\). Rise over run gives us a slope of \\(2\\). 3.10.2 When Does a Derivative Exist? (Differentiability Conditions) Before we use derivatives, we need to know when they exist. In other words, under what conditions is a function differentiable at a point? 3.10.2.1 Requirements for Differentiability At a point \\(x = a\\), a function \\(f\\) is differentiable if its instantaneous rate of change (the derivative) exists and is finite. Formally: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} \\] exists and is a real number. For that limit to exist, three conditions must hold: Requirement Meaning What Can Go Wrong 1. Function is defined \\(f(a)\\) exists Hole, asymptote 2. Function is continuous \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a)\\) Jump or removable discontinuity 3. Slope changes smoothly The left- and right-hand difference quotients approach the same finite value Corner, cusp, vertical tangent, oscillation Put simply: A function is differentiable if it is defined, continuous, and smooth (no sharp turns or infinite slopes). 3.10.2.2 Three Conditions for Continuity at a Point A function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at a point \\(x = a\\) if all three of the following conditions are satisfied: 1. The function is defined at \\(a\\) \\[ f(a) \\text{ exists.} \\] → In practice: Check that there’s a real number assigned to \\(f(a)\\); the point is not a hole, asymptote, or gap. 2. The limit exists as \\(x \\to a\\) \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) \\text{ exists.} \\] → In practice: Approach \\(a\\) from both the left and right. If the left-hand and right-hand limits agree and are finite, the limit exists. 3. The limit equals the function value \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a) \\] → In practice: Compare the numerical (or graphical) limit you found with the actual value of \\(f(a)\\). If they match, the function is continuous at that point. Summary: A function is continuous at \\(x=a\\) if: 1. \\(f(a)\\) exists, 2. \\(\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)\\) exists, and 3. \\(\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = f(a)\\). 3.10.2.3 Smoothness: When Is a Function “Nice Enough” to Differentiate? Continuity alone is not enough for differentiability. A function can be continuous but still have sharp corners, cusps, or vertical tangents where the slope suddenly changes or becomes infinite. To take a derivative, the function must also be smooth — meaning its slope changes gradually. What “Smoothness” Means A function \\(f(x)\\) is smooth at a point \\(x = a\\) if: It is continuous at \\(a\\). Its derivative exists and is finite at \\(a\\). The slope changes continuously (no sudden jumps or sharp turns). In other words, a smooth function has no corners, cusps, breaks, or infinite slopes near that point. How to Test for Smoothness To check whether a function is smooth at \\(x = a\\): Confirm continuity: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a) \\] → The graph is unbroken at \\(a\\). Check the slopes from both sides: \\[ \\lim_{h \\to 0^-}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{h \\to 0^+}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\] → If both limits exist, are finite, and equal each other, the function is smooth at that point. Look for visual cues: A corner or cusp means slopes differ → not smooth. A vertical tangent means infinite slope → not smooth. A continuous curve with gentle slope change → smooth. Why Smoothness Matters Smoothness tells us that the system changes gradually, without abrupt shifts. In environmental modeling, this matters because: Temperature, population, or nutrient levels that change smoothly can be modeled with differential equations. Processes with jumps or discontinuities (like dam releases or landslides) require piecewise or non-differentiable models. Examples Function Smooth? Why \\(f(x) = x^2\\) ✅ Yes Continuous and derivative exists everywhere \\(f(x) = |x|\\) ❌ No Corner at \\(x=0\\) — left and right slopes differ \\(f(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x}\\) ❌ No Vertical tangent at \\(x=0\\) (infinite slope) \\(f(x) = x\\sin(1/x)\\) (define \\(f(0)=0\\)) ❌ No Oscillating slope near \\(x=0\\) \\(f(x) = e^{-x^2}\\) ✅ Yes Infinitely smooth everywhere Summary: &gt; A function must be continuous and smooth (no corners, cusps, or infinite slopes) for its derivative to exist at a point. 3.10.2.4 How to Test for Differentiability To test whether \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(x=a\\): Check definition: Make sure \\(f(a)\\) exists. → If not, derivative automatically fails. Check continuity: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a) \\] → If there’s a jump or hole, \\(f&#39;(a)\\) cannot exist. Compare slopes from both sides: \\[ \\lim_{h \\to 0^-}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{h \\to 0^+}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\] → If they’re equal and finite, \\(f&#39;(a)\\) exists. → If they differ or blow up, \\(f&#39;(a)\\) does not exist. Key relationship: If \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\), then \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(a\\). However, the converse is not always true — \\(\\text{continuous} \\not\\Rightarrow \\text{differentiable}.\\) 3.10.2.5 Common Ways Differentiability Fails Type of Failure Description Example Discontinuity Jump or hole at the point Step in dam outlet temperature Corner or cusp Left and right slopes differ \\(f(x) = |x|\\) at \\(x=0\\) Vertical tangent Slope tends to \\(\\pm\\infty\\) \\(f(x) = (x)^{1/3}\\) at \\(x=0\\) Oscillating slope No single limiting slope \\(f(x) = x \\sin(1/x)\\) at \\(x=0\\) 3.10.2.6 One-Sided and Endpoint Differentiability At the endpoints of a domain (e.g., \\(t \\ge 0\\)), only one side of the function exists. In this case, we use a one-sided derivative: \\[ f&#39;_+(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] The derivative exists at the endpoint if this one-sided limit exists and is finite. 3.10.2.7 Environmental Examples Scenario What’s Happening Differentiability Outcome Dam outlet temperature step Sudden jump between upstream and downstream water Derivative does not exist (discontinuous) Piecewise linear rating curve Continuous but with a sharp corner Derivative does not exist at the corner Sharp flood peak Slope becomes extremely steep Derivative may tend to \\(\\infty\\), so does not exist Smooth glacier retreat curve Continuous and smooth change in slope Differentiable 3.11 Practice: Conceptual Warm-Up These questions will help you review and reinforce key ideas before we dive into graphs and calculations.

Reflect Describe a situation in your field (e.g., climate, marine, ecological, or urban systems) where understanding how fast something is changing could be important. What would the derivative tell you, and how might that help in decision making? 3.12 Practice: Interpreting Derivatives from Graphs In this section, you’ll strengthen your visual intuition about what derivatives represent. We’ll explore how to read increasing/decreasing behavior, slope, and curvature from graphs—and what those features tell us about the underlying system. 1.Identify Slope Behavior from a Graph Below is a sketch of a function representing streamflow over time. Without doing any calculations, answer the following: During which intervals is the function increasing? During which intervals is it decreasing? Find the steepest positive tangent slope and negative tangent slope. Interpret what is physically happening at these moments. Where does the slope of the tangent line appear to be zero? Interpret what is physically happening at these moments. 2.Estimate the Sign of the Derivative For each marked point on the graph below, estimate whether the derivative is: Positive Negative Zero Briefly explain why you came to your conclusion Complete the table: Point Behavior of Function Estimated Sign of Derivative A B C D 3.Sketch the Tangent Line Sketch 3 tangent lines at a point: Where the function is increasing slowly Where the function is increasing rapidly Where the function reaches a minimum Then, graphically estimate the slope of those tangent lines. What do the tangent line slopes mean with respect to the function? 4.Connect Shape to Slope Match the shape of the function to the behavior of its derivative: Function Behavior What Happens to the Derivative? Increasing A. Derivative is positive Decreasing B. Derivative is negative Flat / turning point C. Derivative is zero Steepening D. Derivative is increasing Flattening E. Derivative is decreasing 5.Match the Graph to Its Derivative Which statement is true: The function A is the first derivative of function B The function B is the first derivative of function A An function aren’t related Justify your answer based on slope, curvature, or rate of change 6.Real-World Interpretation \\(H(t)\\) is a graph representing the height (H in meters) of a tidal zone throughout a 24-hour period (t in hours). Based on the graph: When is the tide rising most rapidly? When is the tide falling? Identify all the points where the rate of change of tide height is zero, H’(t) = 0. What do these features represent? 7.Increasing or Decreasing? Consider a graph representing forest biomass over time. Over the 50 years, identify periods of positive, zero and negative slope. In your own words, describe the rate of change through the 50 years Initially: Around yr 25: Towards the end: Identify where the biomass function is concave up and concave down. Try and identify the ‘point of inflection’ - this is the point where the concavity changes from up to down (or down to up). In your own words, describe what these concavity means in relation to the derivative. If the graph started to curve downward: What might that tell us about derivative. 8. Slope Sketch Challenge Sketch a curve that satisfies all of the following: Starts off increasing at \\(x=0\\) Reaches a peak at \\(x =3\\) and then decreases after that Has a steepest decrease aorund \\(x=4\\) and then decreases at a slower rate Label one point where the derivative is positive, one where it is zero, and one where it is negative. 9.Which Graph Matches the Story? Read the scenario below and choose which of the following graphs (A, B, or C) best fits the story. A new invasive plant begins to spread. At first, growth is slow. Then it accelerates rapidly, and finally levels off as it reaches the edges of the available habitat. Graph A: Linear growth Graph B: S-curve (logistic growth) Graph C: Sharp increase followed by sudden drop Why did you choose your answer? What does the slope (derivative) of your choice look like over time? Sketch the derivative of the function you selected 3.13 Practice: Average Rate of Change In this section, you’ll explore the idea of the average rate of change a way of measuring how much a quantity changes per unit of time (or other input) over a chosen interval. Mathematically, it’s the slope of a secant line connecting two points on a graph. You’ll practice working with the formula, sketching diagrams, and interpreting units. You’ll also apply the concept in different contexts. Along the way, you’ll compare positive, negative, and zero rates of change, and connect these slopes to meaningful environmental stories. By the end, you should be able to move confidently between the equation, the graph, and the real-world context to explain what an average rate of change tells us—and what it doesn’t. 1.Concept Check: Formula Write the formula for the average rate of change of a function \\(f(x)\\) from \\(x = a\\) to \\(x = b\\). Sketch a diagram, with a random function, and label the following: On the x-axis label \\(x=a, x=b\\) On the y-axis label \\(f(a), f(b)\\) On the function, mark the points at \\((a,f(a)) , (b,f(b))\\) Sketch the secant line Now explain in your own words what each part of the average rate of change formula means. 2.Units Matter If \\(f(t)\\) represents lake temperature in degrees Celsius and \\(t\\) is measured in months, what are the units of the average rate of change? Why are units important when interpreting your result? 3.From a Table of Data The table below shows the carbon content of soil over time. Year Carbon (kg/m²) 2000 4.1 2005 4.8 2010 5.0 Compute the average rate of change from: 2000 to 2005 2005 to 2010 2000 to 2010 Write a statement interpret your result in context, including units. What conclusions can you make? Note: Given the data is in periods of 5 years, no conclusions of what is happening at timescales below 5 years is possible. 4.Graph Interpretation The graph below shows the area of a glacier over time. Choose two points on the graph, estimate their coordinates, and calculate the average rate of change. How can you visually determine if the glacier is shrinking at a constant, accelerating or decelerating rate? 5.Secant Line Visualization The graph below shows the glacier function with a secant line drawn between \\(t = 5\\) and \\(t = 15\\). Estimate the slope of the secant line and interpret what it means in the context of glacier loss (with units). 6.Environmental Model Application Suppose sea level in a coastal region is modeled by: \\[ S(t) = 3.2t + 45 \\] where \\(S(t)\\) is in millimeters and \\(t\\) is years since 2000. Compute the average rate of change of \\(S(t)\\) from 2010 to 2020. State the units of your answer. Interpret the result in the context of sea level trends. 7.Positive vs. Negative vs. Zero Consider the average rate of change of an environmental quantity of your choice over a specified interval. Give one example where the average rate of change would be positive (increasing). Give one example where it would be negative (decreasing). Give one example where it would be approximately zero (stable). For each example, write 1–2 sentences explaining the context and why the sign makes sense. 8.Comparing Intervals Let \\(f(t) = 100 + 2t - 0.1t^2\\) represent the area covered by an invasive weed in (km\\(^2\\)) and \\(t\\) is years since 2000. Compute the average rate of change of \\(f\\) from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = 5\\). Compute the average rate of change of \\(f\\) from \\(t = 15\\) to \\(t = 20\\). Compare the magnitudes of the two rates. Compare the signs of the two rates Explain what this comparison suggests about how the invasive weed’s rate changes over time. Bonus: Just by looking at the three terms in \\(f(t)\\), can you explain what is happening. Hint: ask your self what happens to each of the terms when t = 0, t is small, t is big 9.Storytelling with Data You are monitoring algae growth in a pond. Between week 2 and week 6, the average rate of change in biomass is \\(0.5 \\,\\text{g}/\\text{m}^2/\\text{week}\\). Rewrite this statement in plain language for a non-technical audience. Briefly describe what additional information (e.g., baseline levels, thresholds, seasonality) would help interpret whether this rate is concerning. Suggest one management action that might follow from this information. 10.Reverse Engineering A study reports that the average rate of change of nitrogen concentration in a stream was \\(-0.2 \\,\\text{mg}/\\text{L}/\\text{year}\\) from 2010 to 2020. Explain the meaning of the negative sign in this context. Provide one plausible environmental reason for this trend List one potential confounding factor that could make this average misleading. State one follow-up analysis you would perform to confirm the trend. 3.14 Practice: Instantaneous Rate of Change In this section, you’ll focus on the instantaneous rate of change, how fast something is changing at one specific moment in time. Unlike the average rate, which looks at overall change across an interval, the instantaneous rate captures the “right now” slope of a tangent line. You’ll practice distinguishing average vs. instantaneous change, sketching tangent lines on curves, and estimating slopes from tables, graphs, and formulas. You’ll also connect these ideas to environmental contexts.By the end, you’ll be able to interpret tangent slopes mathematically and ecologically, explain when instantaneous rates matter more than averages, and use them to make predictions about how environmental systems evolve in real time. 1.Concept Check: Instantaneous vs. Average In your own words, explain the difference between average rate of change and instantaneous rate of change. This time use the equations to help explain yourself - a sketch might even help. Give an environmental example where the two would be very different. 2.Tangent Line Meaning The slope of the tangent line at a point on a graph represents the instantaneous rate of change. Draw a sketch of a random curve and label your axis with some environmental quantity. Pick a point on your sketch and draw a tangent line. Describe in words what the slope means in the context of an environmental scenario you created. 3.Zooming In on a Graph Below is a plot of stream temperature over time. Approximate the instantaneous rate of change at \\(t = 4\\) by drawing a tangent line. Estimate the slope of that tangent line. State what your result means about the rate of temperature change at that moment. 4.Matching Slopes to Graphs Five curves are shown below. Each red point has a different slope. Match each graph to the correct slope value from the list: \\(-1.0\\), \\(4.0\\), \\(-4.0\\), \\(0.5\\), \\(-0.4\\). Explain your reasoning for each match. 5.Instantaneous Rate from a Formula Given: \\[ f(t) = 50 - 4t + 0.2t^2 \\] where \\(t\\) is in years and \\(f(t)\\) is the depth of a wetland pool (cm). In this problem, do not try to calculate the instananous rate of change, but rather lets estimate it from the definition of the derivative: \\[ f&#39;(t) =\\lim_{h \\to 0}\\frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h} \\] Use a small value of \\(h\\), \\(h = 0.1\\), to estimate \\(f&#39;(5)\\). The limit definition equation becomes \\[ f&#39;(t) \\approx \\frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h} \\] Interpret the result in context, including units. Try again using \\(h = 0.001\\), what do you notice about your estimate? Is it approaching a value? 6.Biological Growth Example A fish population is modeled by: \\[ P(t) = 500 \\cdot e^{0.08t} \\] where \\(t\\) is in months and \\(P(t)\\) is the number of individuals. Estimate \\(P&#39;(6)\\) using the limit definition of a derivative. Interpret the meaning of your answer in terms of fish population growth. 7.Zero Instantaneous Rate Give one real-world environmental example where the instantaneous rate of change would be exactly zero at some point in time. Sketch a graph of this situation. Explain why the slope is zero at that point. 8.Comparing Instantaneous Rates Below is a plot of soil moisture over time after a rainstorm. Estimate the instantaneous rate of change at \\(t = 1\\) and \\(t = 5\\) by drawing tangent lines. Compare the magnitudes of the two slopes. Explain what this says about how quickly the soil is drying over time. 9.From Instantaneous to Prediction The temperature in a tide pool is changing at a rate given by: \\[ \\frac{dT}{dt} = -0.3 \\quad \\text{(deg C per hour)} \\] at \\(t = 5\\) hours after sunrise, and the temperature at that time is 22.5 deg C. Use this instantaneous rate to predict the temperature one hour later, assuming the rate stays constant. Explain whether this is likely to be an overestimate or underestimate in a real tide pool system, and why. 3.15 Practice: Limit Definition of a Derivative In this section, you’ll practice the core mathematical manipulations needed to compute derivatives directly from their limit definition. While shortcut rules for differentiation are faster, the limit definition is the foundation that makes those rules possible. Working through examples at specific points, for general functions, and with small numerical approximations will strengthen your algebra skills and deepen your understanding of where derivatives come from. You’ll also explore cases where limits fail (corners, jumps), and apply the definition to real data and environmental contexts. By the end, you should feel comfortable setting up and simplifying the difference quotient, interpreting results with correct units, and explaining why limits are essential to the concept of instantaneous change. 1.Basic Derivative at a Point Use the limit definition of the derivative to compute \\(f&#39;(3)\\) for: \\[ f(x) = x^2 \\] 2.General Derivative from Limit Definition Using the limit definition, find the derivative function \\(f&#39;(x)\\) for: \\[ f(x) = 5x - 7 \\] 3.Cubic Function at a Point Compute \\(f&#39;(2)\\) using the limit definition for: \\[ f(x) = x^3 \\] 4.Estimate with Small \\(h\\) Sometimes it’s easier to estimate a derivative numerically when the exact limit is messy. Use: \\[ f&#39;(a) \\approx \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] with \\(h = 0.001\\) to estimate \\(f&#39;(4)\\) for: \\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{x} \\] Explain why this approximation works for smooth functions. 5.Environmental Example: Tree Height Growth Let \\(H(t) = 2.5\\sqrt{t}\\) represent the height (m) of a young tree after \\(t\\) years. Use \\(h = 0.0001\\) to estimate \\(H&#39;(1)\\). Estimate \\(H&#39;(5)\\) Interpret your answer in words, what is happening to the growth rate? 6.When the Limit Fails to Exist: Corner Consider: \\[ f(x) = |x - 2| \\] Use the limit definition of a derivative from the left and right at \\(x = 2\\). Explain why \\(f&#39;(2)\\) does not exist. 7.When the Limit Fails to Exist: Jump Let: \\[ f(x) = \\begin{cases} 3x + 1, &amp; x &lt; 1 \\\\ x^2, &amp; x \\geq 1 \\end{cases} \\] Use the limit definition of the derivative from each side at \\(x = 1\\). Explain why the derivative fails to exist at that point. 8.Estimate from Real Data The dissolved oxygen (DO) in a lake was measured over several days: Day DO (mg/L) 4.9 8.15 5.0 8.10 5.1 8.05 Use \\(h = 0.1\\) and the limit definition of a derivative to estimate the instantaneous rate of change at \\(t = 5.0\\). Include units in your answer. 9.Derivative of a Quadratic For: \\[ f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5 \\] 1. Derive \\(f&#39;(x)\\) using the limit definition. 2. Now examine you answer, what happened to the \\(3x^2\\) term? What about the \\(4x\\) term? What about the \\(5\\)? 10.Challenge: Fractional Function Using the limit definition, find \\(f&#39;(x)\\) for: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\] State the domain for which the derivative exists. Explain why \\(x = 0\\) must be excluded. 3.16 Practice: Environmental “Explain and Explore” Prompts Having practiced the mechanics of the limit definition, you now have the tools to calculate derivatives from first principles. In the next section, we’ll step back from the algebra and focus on the bigger picture: how rates of change help us interpret environmental systems and real-world data. In this section, you’ll shift from practicing the mechanics of the limit definition to exploring how derivatives help us understand real environmental systems. The goal here is not to calculate every derivative by hand, but to think about what the rate of change means in context—whether it’s the growth of a fish population, the retreat of a glacier, or the decline of dissolved oxygen in a lake. You’ll connect mathematical concepts like slopes and instantaneous change to real-world data, scenarios, and management questions. By the end, you should be able to explain in your own words how derivatives provide insight into environmental patterns and processes, and why they are a powerful tool for interpreting change. 1.Marine Biology Describe a marine ecosystem where tracking a population. What rates would be of interest? What kind of data would you need to compute it? 2.Forestry Think of a forest growth or health measure. How would knowing the derivative help inform forest management decisions? What tools or data sets could you use to estimate it? 3.Climate Science Choose a climate-related variable. What insight would the derivative give about changes in this variable? How might the time scale of measurement (daily vs. yearly) affect your interpretation? 4.Freshwater Ecology Identify a lake, river, or wetland variable that changes in response to seasonal cycles. Describe a situation where you would want to know its rate of change. What measurement frequency would be needed to detect rapid changes? 5.Human–Environment Interaction Pick a human activity that influences an environmental variable. How would you use the derivative to monitor and evaluate the impact? What kinds of monitoring programs or data sets could provide the necessary data?

Thankfully, mathematicians have developed rules that make the process faster, more intuitive, and easier to apply to real-world problems. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use these rules to quickly find derivatives of functions you’re likely to encounter in environmental science—whether you’re modeling the growth of a forest, the spread of an invasive species, or the rate at which pollutants enter a river. We’ll focus on developing your comfort with: Recognizing patterns in how functions are built Reading mathematical expressions like a set of instructions Applying derivative rules like shortcuts to understand change more efficiently By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to: Use basic derivative rules to handle powers, constants, sums, and exponential functions Apply the product, quotient, and chain rule to more complex functions Interpret what each rule tells you about how and why a system is changing Remember: Derivatives aren’t just algebra tricks—they’re windows into the behavior of systems over time. 4.1 Reading Mathematical Expressions Like a Set of Instructions Many students struggle with math not because they don’t understand the underlying concepts, but because they see mathematical expressions as mysterious symbols on a page rather than what they truly are: a sequence of instructions. Each symbol and operator is like a verb telling you what to do next. For example, the “+” sign isn’t just a mark—it literally means “add these numbers together.” A derivative symbol, rather than being abstract, is simply an instruction to “find how fast this quantity is changing.” When you begin to think of math as a set of steps or commands, it becomes less about memorization and more about following a recipe or a set of directions. This shift in perspective can transform math from something intimidating into something procedural and logical, where each step flows naturally from the last. Just as reading a musical score tells a musician which notes to play and when, reading a mathematical expression tells us which operations to perform and in what order. 4.1.1 Think of Math as a Recipe Just like a recipe tells you what to do and in what order, a mathematical expression tells you how to process the input (usually a variable like \\(x\\)) to get an output. Let’s take a simple example: \\[ f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2 \\] This is not just a formula—it’s a set of steps: Take the input \\(x\\) Square it: \\(x^2\\) Multiply by 3: \\(3x^2\\) Multiply the original \\(x\\) by 5: \\(5x\\) Subtract: \\(3x^2 - 5x\\) Add 2 You don’t need to memorize the formula—you just need to follow the steps. 4.1.2 Operators Are Instructions The symbols you see are operators: They tell you what to do with each piece of the function. Symbol Instruction \\(+\\) Add two quantities \\(-\\) Subtract one quantity from another \\(\\times\\) Multiply \\(\\div\\) or fraction bar Divide \\(^\\) Raise to a power \\(\\sqrt{\\cdot}\\) Take the square root Each operator builds on the last. When reading from left to right, use parentheses to help clarify what happens first. 4.1.3 Why This Matters for Derivatives To take a derivative, you must examine how a function is constructed. That’s because: Each term contributes to the overall rate of change Derivative rules apply to specific structures (e.g. products, chains, powers) The better you can “read” an expression, the easier it becomes to: Pick the right rule Avoid mistakes Explain what the math means in context Activity: Reading the Math — What Is the Function Telling You? In environmental science, mathematical models describe how systems change over time. To understand those models, we need to learn how to read equations like a story. Let’s consider a function that models fish population \\(P(t)\\) (in thousands) over time \\(t\\) (in years): \\[ P(t) = 100e^{0.05t} - 20t \\] This expression might describe fish population growth that is limited by fishing, pollution, or resource depletion. Questions to Guide Your Thinking Try to interpret each part of this function like a set of instructions. Answer the questions below to help unpack the meaning of the expression. Overall Structure How many terms are in this function? What is being added or subtracted? First Term: \\(100e^{0.05t}\\) What kind of growth does this term represent? What is the role of the 100? What does the exponent \\(0.05t\\) suggest about the growth rate? Second Term: \\(-20t\\) What kind of relationship is this? Why might the model include a linear decrease? What could be happening in the environment to cause a consistent population loss over time? Big Picture What do you think happens to the population as time goes on? Is there a time when the population might start declining instead of growing? What real-world processes could this equation be modeling? Write Your Own Interpretation In your own words, describe what each part of the function is doing. Try completing this sentence: “The term \\(100e^{0.05t}\\) tells me that the population is…, while the term \\(-20t\\) tells me that…” 4.1.4 Why This Matters Being able to read a function is just as important as being able to solve it. By understanding how the structure reflects environmental processes, you’ll be better prepared to: Apply the correct derivative rules Interpret changes in real systems Communicate what the math means to others 4.1.5 Environmental Example Suppose the temperature of a lake over time is modeled by: \\[ T(t) = 18 + 2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) \\] And we are also given the derivative function: \\[ T&#39;(t) = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) \\] Then: \\(T(t)\\) tells the relationship between temperature an time \\(T&#39;(t)\\) tells you the rate of change in temperature at any moment. \\(\\frac{dT}{dt}\\) is the same thing, just written in a form that highlights that we’re differentiating temperature with respect to time. Reading the math: Try to explain in words what T(t) looks like, break the equation up and tell the story of temperature of this lake. Now try and tell the story of the derivative function. When is the temperature the highest? What is the rate of change at this point? Does this make sense? When is the rate of temperature change the highest? What is the temperature at this point? Does this make sense? 4.1.6 Reflect and Connect Graphical relationship between functions and their derivatives Examine the plots below. Can you explain the relationship between the two lines? What do they tell us about the function? Where is the derivative equal to zero? What feature do you see on the function at these points? The function changes concavity at some point, what do you see in the derivative at this point? Activity: Reading and Writing Derivatives Understanding notation is like learning to read a map: it helps you navigate and communicate mathematical ideas clearly. With practice, it becomes second nature! Understanding derivative notation helps you interpret, communicate, and solve real-world problems. In this activity, you’ll practice converting between different forms and interpreting real-world scenarios. Step 1: Interpreting a Scenario Scenario: The population \\(P\\) of a coastal bird species is changing over time. A biologist says: “The rate of change in population is proportional to the square of the time since a conservation effort began.” Questions: Define the input and output variables in this problem. What does “rate of change in population” suggest mathematically? Write a formula that expresses this relationship using derivative notation. Hint: If \\(y\\) was proportional to \\(x\\) it would mean the \\(y = k.x\\) where \\(k\\) is some constant \\(k\\). Discussion Prompts Why might a conservationist want to know the rate at which a population is changing, not just its size? By the end of this activity, you should feel more confident identifying, interpreting, and converting derivative notation—skills that will help throughout this chapter. 4.2 Introduction to Basic Derivative Rules Now that you understand what a derivative is and how it connects to rates of change, we can start building your toolkit for taking derivatives quickly and confidently. The following table summarizes the most commonly used basic derivative rules. These rules allow us to differentiate many types of functions without going back to the limit definition each time. Keep this table handy—it’s your go-to reference for tackling many of the problems you’ll encounter in calculus and environmental modeling. Rule Formula Example Constant Rule \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(c) = 0\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(7) = 0\\) Power Rule \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = n x^{n - 1}\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 3x^2\\) Constant Multiple \\(\\frac{d}{dx}[c \\cdot f(x)] = c f&#39;(x)\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(5x^4) = 20x^3\\) Sum Rule \\(\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + g(x)] = f&#39;(x) + g&#39;(x)\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + 3x) = 2x + 3\\) Difference Rule \\(\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) - g(x)] = f&#39;(x) - g&#39;(x)\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 4x^2) = 3x^2 - 8x\\) Exponential Rule \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(3e^x) = 3e^x\\) Logarithmic Rule \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(\\ln x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(\\ln(2x)) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) Trig: Sine \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin x) = \\cos x\\) — Trig: Cosine \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(\\cos x) = -\\sin x\\) — 4.2.1 The Constant Rule The Constant Rule tells us how to take the derivative of a constant. A constant doesn’t change, so its rate of change is zero. This makes sense because the derivative measures how quickly a function’s output changes as the input changes. If the function is always the same number, then no matter what value of \\(x\\) you plug in, the result doesn’t move—it’s perfectly flat. Rule: If \\[ f(x) = c \\] where \\(c\\) is a constant (like 3, 5, or 100), then \\[ f&#39;(x) = 0 \\] You can visualize this by graphing a constant function, such as \\(f(x) = 4\\). The graph is a horizontal line. Since the slope of a horizontal line is zero everywhere, the derivative is also zero everywhere. 4.2.2 Environmental Interpretation This rule may seem simple, but it matters in real-world modeling. For example, suppose you measure the background level of a pollutant in a lake that remains steady over time (say, \\(2\\) parts per million). Because this concentration is constant, its rate of change with respect to time is zero. Similarly, a flat baseline temperature in a climate dataset or a fixed conservation quota can be represented as a constant function whose derivative is always zero. The Constant Rule reminds us that when nothing changes, the mathematics reflects that stillness directly: no change means no slope, and thus a derivative of zero.Graphically, we can see this by the fact than a tangent line anywhere on teh funtion would be ‘flat’ with a slope of zero. The Constant Rule tells us how to take the derivative of a constant. A constant doesn’t change, so its rate of change is zero. Rule: If \\[ f(x) = c \\] where \\(c\\) is a constant (like 3, 5, or 100), then \\[ f&#39;(x) = 0 \\] 4.2.2.1 Environmental Example Imagine you’re measuring the temperature in a perfectly climate-controlled greenhouse. If the temperature stays at 25°C all day, the rate of temperature change at any point is zero—it’s constant. So the derivative is: \\[ \\frac{d}{dt}(25) = 0 \\] 4.2.2.2 Example 2 Let \\[ f(x) = 7 \\] Then \\[ f&#39;(x) = 0 \\] 4.2.2.3 Example 3 Let \\[ T(t) = 12 \\] \\(T(t)\\) represents a temperature function that never changes. The rate of change of temperature over time is: \\[ T&#39;(t) = 0 \\] 4.2.2.4 Takeaway If a function doesn’t change—like a flat line on a graph—its slope and rate of change are both zero. So anytime you’re taking the derivative of a constant value, the result is always: \\[ \\boxed{0} \\] 4.2.3 The Power Rule The Power Rule is one of the most important and widely used rules in calculus. It tells us how to differentiate expressions involving powers of \\(x\\). Because so many functions in environmental science (and beyond) can be expressed as polynomials, this rule becomes one of the most frequently applied tools in your calculus toolkit. Rule: If \\[ f(x) = x^n \\] where \\(n\\) is any real number, then \\[ f&#39;(x) = n x^{n - 1} \\] The idea is straightforward: bring the exponent down in front as a multiplier, and then reduce the exponent by one. This simple pattern makes it easy to quickly compute derivatives of terms like \\(x^2\\), \\(x^3\\), or even fractional and negative powers such as \\(x^{1/2}\\) or \\(x^{-3}\\). Examples: \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^5) = 5x^4\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^{-2}) = -2x^{-3}\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(\\sqrt{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}\\) Why it matters: Most polynomials, which are just sums of power functions (like \\(3x^4 - 2x^2 + 7\\)), can be differentiated term by term using the Power Rule. This makes them some of the easiest functions to work with in calculus. Environmental interpretation: The Power Rule shows up when modeling physical quantities that scale with area or volume. For example: The cross-sectional area of a circular tree trunk is proportional to \\(r^2\\). If the radius of the trunk is changing over time, the rate of change of area can be found using the Power Rule. The volume of a sphere (like a balloon or water droplet) depends on \\(r^3\\). Differentiating with respect to time gives the rate at which volume changes as the radius grows or shrinks. In allometric scaling (relationships between body size and metabolism), power functions often describe how one ecological trait depends on another, and their rates of change can be quickly found using this rule. By mastering the Power Rule, you gain a quick way to move from expressions of size or shape to expressions of change—a central theme in applying calculus to environmental science. 4.2.4 Polynomials and Their Derivatives Here’s how different powers of \\(x\\) behave and how their derivatives affect the shape of their graphs: Power (n) Function \\(f(x) = x^n\\) Graph Type Derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\) Graph of Derivative 0 \\(x^0 = 1\\) Constant \\(0\\) Flat line at 0 1 \\(x^1 = x\\) Linear (straight line) \\(1\\) Flat line at 1 2 \\(x^2\\) Quadratic (parabola) \\(2x\\) Linear 3 \\(x^3\\) Cubic curve \\(3x^2\\) Parabola 4 \\(x^4\\) Quartic (W-shape) \\(4x^3\\) Cubic curve Note: The derivative of a polynomial is always another polynomial of one degree lower. 4.2.5 Environmental Interpretation Suppose you’re modeling tree growth height over time using a power function: \\[ H(t) = t^2 \\] The rate of growth at any time \\(t\\) is: \\[ H&#39;(t) = 2t \\] This means the tree grows faster as time increases—something we often observe in early growth stages of many plants. 4.2.6 Example 1 Let \\[ f(x) = x^5 \\] It helps to identify the different parts of the function. So in this function \\(n=5\\). So we could now replace 5 into the power rule derivative expression Then \\[ f&#39;(x) = n x^{n - 1} \\\\ f&#39;(x) = (5) x^{5-1} \\\\ f&#39;(x) = 5x^4 \\] 4.2.7 Example 2 Let \\[ V(t) = t^3 \\] Where V(t) represents the volume of glacial melt water over time. To find the rate of melt is we would use the power law with \\(n=3\\) \\[ V&#39;(t) = nt^{n-1} \\\\ V&#39;(t) = n(3)t^{3-1} \\\\ V&#39;(t) = 3t^2 \\] 4.2.8 Takeaway Any time you see a variable raised to a power, apply the power rule: Multiply by the original exponent Subtract 1 from the exponent This rule works for whole numbers, fractions, and even negative exponents! Derivatives of fractional powers Find the derivative of \\[ y = \\sqrt {x} \\] Hint: can you write \\(\\sqrt {x}\\) as a power? 4.2.9 The Constant Multiple Rule The Constant Multiple Rule tells us that when a function is multiplied by a constant, we can find the derivative by simply multiplying the derivative of the function by that constant. This rule may feel obvious once you see it, but it’s surprisingly powerful. It tells us that constants don’t change the shape of the function’s derivative—they only scale it up or down. The slope patterns all stay the same, just stretched or compressed vertically. 4.2.9.1 Constant Multiple Rule (Function Notation) If \\[ f(x) = c \\cdot g(x) \\] where \\(c\\) is a constant, then \\[ f&#39;(x) = c \\cdot g&#39;(x) \\] 4.2.9.2 Constant Multiple Rule (Leibniz / Operator Notation) We can also write this using the derivative operator \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\): \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ c \\cdot g(x) \\right] = c \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ g(x) \\right] \\] This shows that the operator \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\) “passes through” the constant—it only acts on the function part \\(g(x)\\), not on the constant. This works because constants don’t change as \\(x\\) changes, so they don’t contribute to the rate of change. Instead, they simply scale the rate of change of the underlying function. 4.2.10 Environmental Interpretation The Constant Multiple Rule is especially important in environmental modeling, where constants often represent scaling factors such as efficiency, conversion rates, or unit adjustments. These constants don’t alter how a system changes, only the magnitude of that change. Suppose the CO₂ uptake by a certain plant species is modeled by: \\[ U(t) = 0.3t^2 \\] Here we can map the function to the rule: \\(c = 0.3\\) (a constant that might represent efficiency or an uptake rate coefficient) \\(g(t) = t^2\\) (the underlying growth process in time) Applying the Constant Multiple Rule: \\[ U&#39;(t) = c \\cdot g&#39;(t) = (0.3)(2t) = 0.6t \\] This result tells us that the CO₂ uptake rate increases linearly with time. The coefficient \\(0.6\\) is simply the constant scaling the underlying process. 4.2.11 Example 1 Let \\[ f(x) = 7x^3 \\] Here, \\(c = 7\\) and \\(g(x) = x^3\\). Differentiate \\(g(x)\\) using the Power Rule: \\[ g&#39;(x) = 3x^2 \\] Now apply the Constant Multiple Rule: \\[ f&#39;(x) = c \\cdot g&#39;(x) = 7 \\cdot (3x^2) = 21x^2 \\] 4.2.12 Key Idea The constant just comes along for the ride. Differentiate the function as usual, then multiply the result by the constant. Tip: This rule is especially helpful when dealing with models where scaling factors are built into the equation. 4.2.13 The Sum and Difference Rules The Sum and Difference Rules tell us that the derivative of a sum or difference is simply the sum or difference of the derivatives. In other words, differentiation distributes over addition and subtraction. This is powerful because it means we can take a complicated expression, break it into smaller, more manageable parts, and then handle each piece on its own before recombining the results. For example, suppose we want to differentiate \\[ f(x) = 3x^2 + \\sin(x) - e^x. \\] Instead of treating the entire function as a single, tangled object, we can separate it into three parts: \\(3x^2\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\), and \\(-e^x\\). We find the derivative of each term individually (\\(6x\\), \\(\\cos(x)\\), and \\(-e^x\\), respectively) and then add them back together. The process mirrors how scientists often analyze complex environmental systems—by breaking them into components that are easier to study before piecing them back together into a whole. In environmental contexts, this rule shows up naturally. Imagine a model of a river’s flow rate that combines multiple factors: snowmelt, rainfall, and groundwater inputs. Each of these factors may follow its own mathematical relationship with time. By using the Sum Rule, we can calculate the overall rate of change in river flow by adding the individual rates of change of snowmelt, rainfall, and groundwater. This makes the mathematics not only simpler but also more meaningful, because it aligns with how we understand real-world systems as combinations of interacting parts. 4.2.13.1 Rule (Function Notation) If \\[ f(x) = g(x) \\pm h(x) \\] then \\[ f&#39;(x) = g&#39;(x) \\pm h&#39;(x) \\] 4.2.13.2 Rule (Leibniz / Operator Notation) Using operator notation: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ g(x) \\pm h(x) \\right] = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ g(x) \\right] \\pm \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ h(x) \\right] \\] The derivative distributes over addition and subtraction. This works because differentiation is a linear operation. 4.2.14 Environmental Interpretation Suppose a wetland ecosystem has total carbon uptake modeled as the sum of uptake from two plant species: \\[ U_1(t) = (0.2t^2 + 0.5t) \\\\ U_2(t) = (t^3) \\\\ U_T= U_1(t)+U_2(t)=0.2t^2 + 0.5t +t^3 \\] It makes sense then that the total uptake, \\(U_T\\), would be the uptake from both the species added together. The rate of total uptake is: \\[ U_T&#39;(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(0.2t^2 + 0.5t +t^3) \\] Using the sum derivative rule we could re-write the about expression as the sum of three derivatives: \\[ U_T&#39;(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(0.2t^2) + \\frac{d}{dt}(0.5t) + \\frac{d}{dt}(t^3) \\] One it is in this form we apply the rules we let he math tell us what to do. The above expression is saying “the rate of uptake is the sum of three derivatives”. Remember \\(\\frac{d}{dt}\\) is an operatator telling us to ‘take the derivative of’ what ever comes next. [ \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{1st Term:} \\quad &amp; \\frac{d}{dt}(0.2t^2) = 0.2 \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt}(t^2) = 0.2 \\cdot (2t) = 0.4t \\\\[6pt] \\text{2nd Term:} \\quad &amp; \\frac{d}{dt}(0.5t) = 0.5 \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt}(t) = 0.5 \\cdot (1) = 0.5 \\\\[6pt] \\text{3rd Term:} \\quad &amp; \\frac{d}{dt}(t^3) = 3t^2 \\\\[10pt] \\end{aligned}\\] ] So the derivative is: \\[ U&#39;_T(t) = 0.4t + 0.5 + 3t^2. \\] We applied the derivative to each term, then combined the results. For the first and second term we used the constant multiplier rule and power rules. For the third term all we needed was the power rule. 4.2.15 Example 1 Let \\[ f(x) = x^3 + 5x - 4 \\] Then \\[ f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 + 5 \\] (The derivative of a constant like \\(-4\\) is 0.) 4.2.16 Example 2 Let \\[ P(t) = 6t^2 - 4t + 9 \\] Then \\[ P&#39;(t) = 12t - 4 \\] 4.2.17 Key Idea Break the function into pieces using + and – signs. Apply known derivative rules to each term, then combine them. Tip: Combine the Constant Multiple Rule with the Sum and Difference Rules to quickly differentiate polynomials and real-world models. 4.2.18 The Exponential Rule One of the most remarkable functions in all of calculus is the natural exponential function (e): \\[ f(x) = e^x \\] This function is unique because its rate of change is equal to its value at every point: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} (e^x) = e^x \\] This means that the tangent line at any point on the graph has a slope equal to the height of the curve at that point. No other elementary function has this “self-replicating” property. If the function’s value is small, its slope is small. If the function’s value is large, its slope is large. Growth and steepness always keep pace with each other. This is why \\(e^x\\) is so central in calculus: it perfectly embodies the idea of proportional change. 4.2.19 Environmental Interpretation Exponential functions appear frequently in environmental science because many natural processes change at a rate proportional to their current size or amount. This “proportional change” is what gives rise to exponential growth or decay. Some common examples include: Population growth in ideal conditions When resources are abundant and limiting factors are minimal, populations can grow exponentially. For example, bacteria in a nutrient-rich environment may double at a fixed time interval. While no population can grow exponentially forever, this model is useful for understanding the early phases of population expansion or for comparing how fast different species can reproduce. Radioactive decay Radioactive isotopes, such as carbon-14, decay at a rate proportional to the remaining quantity. This predictable exponential decay makes them powerful tools for dating environmental samples, such as using radiocarbon dating to estimate the age of fossils, soils, or archaeological artifacts. Spread of invasive species or diseases Invasive plants or pathogens can initially spread exponentially when introduced into a new habitat, before natural controls (predators, competition, or resource limits) slow their growth. Atmospheric processes Exponential decay is also used to model how pollutants or greenhouse gases diminish in the atmosphere over time through processes like chemical breakdown or absorption. These examples highlight why exponential functions are so central to environmental science: they provide a first-order approximation of how systems evolve when the rate of change depends directly on the current state. Later, more complex models (e.g., logistic growth or coupled differential equations) can capture limits and interactions, but exponential functions form the foundation. 4.2.20 Key Insight The exponential function grows faster and faster, but always in proportion to how large it already is. This self-replicating property makes it powerful—and dangerous—in real-world systems. Discussion Prompt Can you think of natural exponential processes that are of concern&gt; 4.2.21 Examples \\(\\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx} 5e^x = 5e^x\\) ⟶ constant multiple rule still applies \\(\\frac{d}{dx} e^{2x} = 2e^{2x}\\) ⟶ chain rule! (covered next) 4.2.22 Summary The derivative of \\(e^x\\) is itself. Exponential models describe growth at a rate proportional to value. This rule forms the backbone of many environmental models involving runaway feedback, like CO₂ buildup or species invasion. 4.2.23 The Natural Logarithm Rule The natural logarithm function \\(\\ln(x)\\) is the inverse of the exponential function \\(e^x\\). While the exponential function grows at a rate proportional to its current size, the logarithm grows more and more slowly as \\(x\\) increases. This slowing growth makes the logarithm especially useful in environmental models where diminishing returns or slowing growth are observed—for example, nutrient absorption in plants, the effect of adding fertilizer to soil, or population responses as they approach a carrying capacity. 4.2.23.1 Inverse Functions An inverse function basically undoes what the original function does. If a function takes you from input → output, the inverse takes you from that output → back to the input. Think of it like this: Multiplying by 2 and then dividing by 2 get you back where you started. Exponentials and logarithms work the same way—\\(e^x\\) and \\(\\ln(x)\\) undo each other. So, an inverse function is just a mathematical “reverse button.” 4.2.24 Key Insight The logarithm is only defined for positive values of \\(x\\). Its rate of change is steep when \\(x\\) is close to zero, but gradually flattens out as \\(x\\) gets larger. The derivative captures this behavior: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\] This formula tells us that as \\(x\\) grows, the slope decreases. For very large \\(x\\), the slope approaches zero—indicating almost no change. 4.2.25 Examples Basic Rule \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\] At \\(x=1\\), the slope is \\(1\\). At \\(x=10\\), the slope is only \\(0.1\\). Log of a scaled input \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(3x) = \\frac{1}{3x} \\cdot 3 = \\frac{1}{x} \\] Notice that the factor of 3 cancels out in this case, showing that \\(\\ln(3x)\\) grows at the same rate as \\(\\ln(x)\\). Log of a power \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(x^2) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\cdot 2x = \\frac{2}{x} \\] This highlights how the chain rule applies inside logarithms: the derivative of the “inside” function modifies the result. 4.2.26 Environmental Interpretation The logarithmic rule is useful for modeling processes where growth slows over time or with increasing input: Resource depletion: As resources (like groundwater or fisheries) are consumed, the additional gain from each new unit of effort declines. Nutrient absorption: Plants absorb nutrients quickly when soil is depleted, but the uptake rate slows as the soil becomes saturated. Population growth toward carrying capacity: While early growth may look exponential, the long-term response often involves slowing growth that logarithms help describe. In each case, the logarithm captures the idea that the “marginal returns” diminish as the system grows larger. 4.2.27 Summary The derivative of \\(\\ln(x)\\) is \\(\\tfrac{1}{x}\\). The slope decreases as \\(x\\) increases, showing diminishing change. This makes logarithmic models ideal for studying slowing growth, saturation effects, and resource limits in environmental systems. 4.3 Product, Quotient, and Chain Rule So far, we’ve explored basic derivative rules for individual terms—constants, powers, exponentials, and logarithms. But what happens when functions are combined? In real-world environmental systems, variables are rarely isolated. Instead, they interact: A pollution level might depend on population size × emission rate A species population might grow based on a changing habitat and food supply A rate of nutrient absorption might be modeled by a composite function like \\(\\ln(e^{kt})\\) In these situations, we need a new set of rules to differentiate combined functions: The Product Rule: for multiplying two functions The Quotient Rule: for dividing two functions The Chain Rule: for nested (composite) functions These rules help us break down complex expressions into manageable parts, and they are essential for modeling dynamic, interconnected systems in environmental science. 4.3.1 Summary Table: Rules for Combined Functions Rule Expression Derivative Product Rule \\(f(x) \\cdot g(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x) \\cdot g(x) + f(x) \\cdot g&#39;(x)\\) Quotient Rule \\(\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\) \\(\\frac{f&#39;(x) \\cdot g(x) - f(x) \\cdot g&#39;(x)}{[g(x)]^2}\\) Chain Rule \\(f(g(x))\\) \\(f&#39;(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x)\\) We’ll walk through each of these rules with examples and visuals that connect directly to environmental applications. 4.3.2 Real-World Applications of Product, Quotient, and Chain Rules 4.3.2.1 Product Rule: Two Changing Quantities Multiplied Scenario: Modeling carbon emissions from a city. Let: - \\(P(t)\\) = population size (increasing over time) - \\(E(t)\\) = emissions per person Then total emissions is: \\[ C(t) = P(t) \\cdot E(t) \\] To find how fast emissions are growing, we use the product rule: \\[ C&#39;(t) = P&#39;(t) \\cdot E(t) + P(t) \\cdot E&#39;(t) \\] This lets us understand whether total emissions are rising due to more people, more emissions per person, or both. 4.3.2.2 Quotient Rule: One Changing Quantity Divided by Another Scenario: Modeling pollution concentration in a lake. Let: - \\(A(t)\\) = total pollutant amount (changing due to runoff or decay) - \\(V(t)\\) = lake volume (changing due to rainfall or evaporation) Pollution concentration is: \\[ C(t) = \\frac{A(t)}{V(t)} \\] To find how the concentration is changing, we use the quotient rule: \\[ C&#39;(t) = \\frac{A&#39;(t)V(t) - A(t)V&#39;(t)}{[V(t)]^2} \\] This shows that increasing volume (dilution) can decrease concentration, even if pollutant levels stay the same. 4.3.2.3 Chain Rule: One Function Inside Another Scenario: Modeling temperature-dependent species growth. Let: \\(T(t)\\) = temperature over time (changes daily or seasonally) \\(G(T)\\) = growth rate as a function of temperature Then species growth rate over time is: \\[ G(t) = G(T(t)) \\] To find the rate of change of growth over time: \\[ G&#39;(t) = G&#39;(T) \\cdot T&#39;(t) \\] This lets us account for how growth indirectly changes with time due to temperature variation. These examples show how derivative rules help us uncover the drivers of change in complex, real-world systems. 4.4 The Product Rule In calculus, the Product Rule is used to take the derivative of a product of two functions. If a quantity depends on two changing functions multiplied together, we can’t simply take the derivative of each part independently. We need a rule that accounts for how both parts change together. The rule is written as: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\big[f(x)\\,g(x)\\big] \\;=\\; f(x)\\,g&#39;(x) \\;+\\; f&#39;(x)\\,g(x). \\] You may also see this written using \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) notation: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}(uv) \\;=\\; u\\,\\frac{dv}{dx} \\;+\\; \\frac{du}{dx}\\,v \\quad\\text{or}\\quad \\frac{d}{dx}(uv) \\;=\\; u\\,v&#39; + u&#39;\\,v. \\] Here, \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are stand-ins for the two functions being multiplied. They’re just labels to organize your work. 4.4.1 Why Does the Rule Work? (Intuition) Think of a rectangle whose sides change with \\(x\\): width \\(= f(x)\\), height \\(= g(x)\\). The area is \\(A(x) = f(x)\\,g(x)\\). When \\(x\\) increases a tiny amount, both sides change a tiny bit. The area increases due to: 1) the width changing while the height is held (momentarily) fixed, plus 2) the height changing while the width is held (momentarily) fixed. Those two contributions add up: \\[ \\Delta A \\approx f(x)\\,\\Delta g \\;+\\; g(x)\\,\\Delta f \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad A&#39;(x) = f(x)g&#39;(x) + f&#39;(x)g(x). \\] Mnemonic: “first × (derivative of second) + (derivative of first) × second.” Only one part gets differentiated in each term. Quick Activity: Visualizing the Product Rule with Area Imagine a square whose side length depends on \\(x\\). At some moment, its sides have length \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\). The area is: \\[ A(x) = f(x) \\cdot g(x) \\] Now suppose \\(x\\) increases by a tiny amount. Both sides of the square grow a little bit, which means new thin strips of area get added around the edges. Instructions: 1. Draw a rectangle on your paper. Label the horizontal side \\(f(x)\\) and the vertical side \\(g(x)\\). 2. Increase both sides slightly: imagine the new side lengths are \\(f(x) + \\Delta f\\) and \\(g(x) + \\Delta g\\). 3. Shade in the new area that gets added: A horizontal strip of area: \\(f(x)\\cdot \\Delta g\\) A vertical strip of area: \\(g(x)\\cdot \\Delta f\\) (Ignore the tiny corner piece \\(\\Delta f \\cdot \\Delta g\\)—it’s very small compared to the strips.) Identify each piece: which strip corresponds to \\(f(x)\\,g&#39;(x)\\), and which to \\(f&#39;(x)\\,g(x)\\)? Connect back: notice that the total new area is just the sum of those strips, which is exactly the Product Rule. Discussion Prompt Why do we get two separate terms instead of one? What would happen if we only counted one strip? 4.4.2 Step-by-Step Example (using \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) notation) Differentiate \\(f(x) = (2x^2)(\\ln x)\\). Label parts clearly Let’s break the product into two pieces: \\(u = 2x^2\\) (a polynomial) \\(v = \\ln x\\) (a logarithm) Tip: Identifying \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) first prevents mistakes later when plugging into the Product Rule. It’s like naming the players before describing the play. Differentiate each part \\(u&#39; = \\frac{d}{dx}(2x^2) = 4x\\) \\(v&#39; = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\ln x) = \\tfrac{1}{x}\\) Notice how the rules we’ve already learned come together here: the Power Rule for \\(2x^2\\), and the Logarithm Rule for \\(\\ln x\\). Apply the Product Rule Recall: \\((uv)&#39; = u\\,v&#39; + u&#39;\\,v\\). Substitute in each part: \\[ f&#39;(x) = u\\,v&#39; + u&#39;\\,v = (2x^2)\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + (4x)(\\ln x). \\] The first term represents the change when \\(\\ln x\\) changes while \\(2x^2\\) stays fixed. The second term represents the change when \\(2x^2\\) changes while \\(\\ln x\\) stays fixed. Together, they capture the total change. Simplify the expression \\[ f&#39;(x) = 2x + 4x\\ln x. \\] Always check if terms can be simplified. Here, \\(\\tfrac{2x^2}{x} = 2x\\). A simpler final answer makes patterns easier to see and avoids unnecessary complexity. What we learned here: The Product Rule ensures both changing parts of the product are accounted for. Each derivative rule (Power, Logarithm, Constant Multiple) can appear inside a Product Rule problem. Simplification at the end often reveals a cleaner structure—in this case, notice how both terms share a factor of \\(x\\): \\[ f&#39;(x) = x(2 + 4\\ln x). \\] Factoring can make the expression easier to interpret, especially if you’ll use it later in optimization or modeling. 4.4.3 Step-by-Step Example (using \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) notation) Differentiate \\[ h(x) = (x^3)(e^x). \\] Identify each function Let \\(f(x) = x^3\\) Let \\(g(x) = e^x\\) Then \\(h(x) = f(x) \\cdot g(x)\\). Differentiate each part \\(f&#39;(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 3x^2\\) \\(g&#39;(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x\\) Notice how we’re reusing familiar rules: the Power Rule and the Exponential Rule. Apply the Product Rule Recall: \\[ (fg)&#39; = f \\cdot g&#39; + f&#39; \\cdot g \\] Substitute \\(f(x), f&#39;(x), g(x), g&#39;(x)\\): \\[ h&#39;(x) = f(x)g&#39;(x) + f&#39;(x)g(x) \\] \\[ h&#39;(x) = (x^3)(e^x) + (3x^2)(e^x). \\] Simplify the expression Factor out the common term \\(e^x\\): \\[ h&#39;(x) = e^x(x^3 + 3x^2). \\] Factoring here makes the structure more visible: the exponential \\(e^x\\) “comes along for the ride,” while the polynomial part handles the changing powers of \\(x\\). Takeaway: When using \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) notation, the Product Rule formula is straightforward: Multiply the original \\(f\\) by the derivative of \\(g\\), Add the derivative of \\(f\\) times the original \\(g\\). 4.4.4 Environmental Example Suppose total forest biomass \\(B(t)\\) is the product of: - Tree density \\(D(t) = 50e^{0.02t}\\) (number of trees per hectare, growing approximately exponentially), - Average tree mass \\(M(t) = 100 + 5\\sin t\\) (average mass of an individual tree, fluctuating slightly with seasonal cycles). Then the total biomass is: \\[ B(t) = D(t)\\,M(t). \\] 4.4.4.1 Step-by-Step Differentiation Label each part clearly \\(u = 50e^{0.02t}\\) (density of trees, growing steadily) \\(v = 100 + 5\\sin t\\) (mass per tree, oscillating over time) Splitting the model into density and mass mirrors how ecologists break down population and individual traits. Differentiate each part \\(u&#39; = \\frac{d}{dt}(50e^{0.02t}) = 50 \\cdot 0.02e^{0.02t} = e^{0.02t}\\) (density is increasing at a constant 2% growth rate) \\(v&#39; = \\frac{d}{dt}(100 + 5\\sin t) = 5\\cos t\\) (tree mass changes cyclically, speeding up when \\(\\cos t\\) is large) Notice how exponential growth (for density) and oscillatory change (for mass) combine in this model. Apply the Product Rule \\[ B&#39;(t) = u\\,v&#39; + u&#39;\\,v \\] Substituting: \\[ B&#39;(t) = 50e^{0.02t}\\cdot 5\\cos t \\;+\\; e^{0.02t}(100 + 5\\sin t). \\] The first term represents biomass change driven by seasonal shifts in mass while density stays fixed. The second term represents biomass change driven by density growth while tree mass stays fixed. Interpretation of the Result First term: \\(50e^{0.02t}\\cdot 5\\cos t\\) captures the effect of seasonal mass fluctuations across all trees. When \\(\\cos t &gt; 0\\), trees are gaining mass on average, boosting biomass. When \\(\\cos t &lt; 0\\), they are losing mass, reducing biomass. Second term: \\(e^{0.02t}(100 + 5\\sin t)\\) captures the effect of increasing density. Even if individual trees aren’t changing much, adding more trees steadily increases total biomass. Together, these terms highlight how two biological processes interact: population expansion and seasonal changes in individual growth. The Product Rule ensures both are accounted for simultaneously. Big Idea: The Product Rule isn’t just an abstract formula—it matches how environmental systems behave. Complex outcomes often come from two simpler factors interacting, and calculus gives us a precise way to measure those interactions. 4.4.5 When to Use (and Not Use) Use Product Rule when the expression is a product of two changing functions (e.g., \\(x^2 e^x\\), \\(\\ln x \\cdot \\sin x\\), \\(D(t)M(t)\\)). Don’t use Product Rule for a constant multiple: \\(7x^3\\) → use the Constant Multiple Rule. If you see a composition (e.g., \\(e^{2x}\\), \\(\\ln(x^2+1)\\)), that’s the Chain Rule (sometimes combined with a Product Rule if there’s also a product). 4.4.6 Common Pitfalls &amp; Quick Checks Wrong pattern: \\((uv)&#39; \\neq u&#39;v&#39;\\) — you must add the two terms \\(u\\,v&#39; + u&#39;\\,v\\). Units check: If \\(u\\) has units A and \\(v\\) has units B, then each term in \\(u\\,v&#39; + u&#39;\\,v\\) has units A·B per unit \\(x.\\) Mismatched units can reveal algebra slips. Symmetry check: Swapping \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) leaves \\(u\\,v&#39; + u&#39;\\,v\\) unchanged—good sanity check. Quick Practice Differentiate \\(f(x) = x^3\\ln x\\). Differentiate \\(g(x) = (1+x^2)\\,e^x\\) and factor the result. Environmental: If river discharge \\(Q(t) = A(t)\\,v(t)\\) with cross-sectional area \\(A\\) and velocity \\(v\\), write \\(Q&#39;(t)\\) and explain each term in words. 4.4.7 Summary The Product Rule handles derivatives of products: \\[ (fg)&#39; = f\\,g&#39; + f&#39;\\,g. \\] Intuition: change from the first factor plus change from the second factor. Differentiate one factor at a time, then add. 4.5 The Quotient Rule In calculus, the Quotient Rule is used to take the derivative of a quotient of two functions. If a quantity depends on one function divided by another, we need a rule that tells us how to account for both the numerator and the denominator changing at the same time. The rule is written as: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\right] = \\frac{g(x) \\cdot f&#39;(x) - f(x) \\cdot g&#39;(x)}{[g(x)]^2} \\] You may also see this written using \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) notation: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{u}{v} \\right) = \\frac{v \\cdot u&#39; - u \\cdot v&#39;}{v^2} \\] Here, \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are dummy variables—stand-ins for the numerator and denominator functions. They’re useful for understanding the structure of the rule, but in real problems, you’ll work with named expressions like \\(f(x)\\), \\(C(t)\\), or \\(B(t)\\). 4.5.1 Why Does the Rule Work? When dividing two functions, both the top and bottom are changing—and that affects the overall rate of change. The Quotient Rule carefully balances these changes: It starts with the derivative of the top times the bottom Then subtracts the top times the derivative of the bottom And finally divides everything by the square of the bottom function 4.5.2 Step-by-Step Process (Quotient Rule) Differentiate: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{2x^2 + 3}{x + 1}. \\] Label each part \\(u = 2x^2 + 3\\) (the numerator) \\(v = x + 1\\) (the denominator) Just like in the Product Rule, we split the expression into two parts, but now we have a fraction. It helps to keep “top = \\(u\\)” and “bottom = \\(v\\)” in mind. Differentiate each part \\(u&#39; = \\frac{d}{dx}(2x^2 + 3) = 4x\\) \\(v&#39; = \\frac{d}{dx}(x+1) = 1\\) Nothing tricky here: numerator is a polynomial, denominator is linear. Apply the Quotient Rule Recall the formula: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{v\\cdot u&#39; - u\\cdot v&#39;}{v^2}. \\] Substituting our parts: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{(x+1)(4x) - (2x^2+3)(1)}{(x+1)^2}. \\] Notice the subtraction in the numerator. This is what distinguishes the Quotient Rule from the Product Rule. A useful mnemonic: “low d-high minus high d-low, over low-low.” (low = denominator, high = numerator) Simplify the expression Expand and combine terms in the numerator: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{4x^2 + 4x - 2x^2 - 3}{(x+1)^2}. \\] Combine like terms: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{2x^2 + 4x - 3}{(x+1)^2}. \\] Simplifying makes the structure clearer and prepares the result for later use (like plugging into a model or checking limits). 4.5.3 Key Idea The Quotient Rule accounts for the fact that both numerator and denominator are changing. The subtraction ensures we capture the effect of the denominator’s change correctly. Forgetting the subtraction is one of the most common student mistakes. 4.5.4 Example 2: Environmental Application Suppose the nutrient concentration in a lake is modeled by a ratio: Total nutrient mass: \\(N(t) = 100 + 20t\\) Water volume: \\(V(t) = 500 + 10\\cos(t)\\) Then: \\[ C(t) = \\frac{N(t)}{V(t)} = \\frac{100 + 20t}{500 + 10\\cos(t)} \\] Let’s find the rate of change \\(C&#39;(t)\\), step by step. 4.5.4.1 Step-by-Step Process Label each part: Let \\(u = 100 + 20t\\) Let \\(v = 500 + 10\\cos(t)\\) Differentiate each part: \\(u&#39; = 20\\) \\(v&#39; = -10\\sin(t)\\) Apply the quotient rule: \\[ C&#39;(t) = \\frac{v \\cdot u&#39; - u \\cdot v&#39;}{v^2} \\] \\[ C&#39;(t) = \\frac{(500 + 10\\cos(t))(20) - (100 + 20t)(-10\\sin(t))}{(500 + 10\\cos(t))^2} \\] Simplify the expression: \\[ C&#39;(t) = \\frac{10000 + 200\\cos(t) + 1000\\sin(t) + 200t\\sin(t)}{(500 + 10\\cos(t))^2} \\] This expression tells you how quickly the concentration is changing over time—factoring in both the growing nutrient load and seasonal fluctuations in water volume. 4.5.5 Summary The Quotient Rule helps you differentiate when one function is divided by another. Remember: - Differentiate the top and bottom separately - Apply the rule: \\(\\frac{v \\cdot u&#39; - u \\cdot v&#39;}{v^2}\\) - Keep track of signs—subtraction matters! - This rule tells you exactly what to do in a structured, step-by-step way. 4.6 The Chain Rule In calculus, the Chain Rule is used when you’re taking the derivative of a composite function—that is, one function nested inside another. This happens all the time in environmental modeling, where one variable depends on another that itself is changing. The Chain Rule is written as: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ f(g(x)) \\right] = f&#39;(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x) \\] Or in \\(u\\)-notation: \\[ \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dx} \\] Here, \\(y = f(u)\\) and \\(u = g(x)\\), so you’re taking the derivative of the outer function, evaluated at the inner function, and then multiplying by the derivative of the inner function. 4.6.1 Composite Functions (Plain English) Before you apply the Chain Rule, it’s helpful to get a clear sense of what a composite function is in everyday terms. A composite function is when one function feeds into another. Think of it like a pipeline: the output of the first function becomes the input of the second. Examples in words: “Take a number, square it, then take the sine.” That’s \\(\\sin(x^2)\\). “Take a number, double it, then plug it into an exponential.” That’s \\(e^{2x}\\). So instead of two functions side by side (product) or one divided by another (quotient), a composite is one function wrapped inside another. Plain English rule: When you differentiate a composite, you have to respect the layers. Start with the outside layer, then peel back and multiply by the derivative of the inside layer. It’s like peeling an onion, one layer at a time. 4.6.2 Why Does the Rule Work? Chain Rule Hike Let’s explore the Chain Rule through a real-world analogy. Your trail distance itself depends on how much time you’ve been walking. So the final question is: how fast is your distance from camp changing with time? Step 2: Break down the layers Let’s introduce some symbols: Let \\(C\\) = your distance from camp (in miles). Let \\(s\\) = your distance along the trail (in miles). Let \\(t\\) = time (in hours). Try this: - What is C a function of? Write the expression - What is s a function of? Write the expression - Can you combine these two functions as a composite function? Step 3: Think about the rates separately Ask yourself two smaller questions: How does \\(C\\) change when \\(s\\) changes? How does \\(s\\) change when \\(t\\) changes? Step 4: Combine the rates Now connect them. To find how \\(C\\) changes with respect to \\(t\\): \\[ \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{dC}{ds} \\cdot \\frac{ds}{dt}. \\] This is the Chain Rule in action: the overall rate is the product of the two linked rates. Step 5: Reflect Why do we multiply instead of add? What would happen if the trail were straight versus winding? How does this analogy help you understand why the Chain Rule is needed when functions are “nested”? The Chain Rule is just formalizing the idea of a “rate of a rate.” If you know how fast one thing changes with another, and how that second thing changes with time, you can multiply the two to find the total rate of change. 4.6.3 Step-by-Step Process (Chain Rule in Action) Differentiate: \\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{3x^2 + 1}. \\] Identify inner and outer functions The function has a nesting: The inner function is what’s inside the square root: \\[ u = 3x^2 + 1. \\] The outer function is the square root itself: \\[ f(u) = \\sqrt{u} = u^{1/2}. \\] Tip: Always peel back the layers like an onion. First ask, “What’s wrapped around the \\(x\\)?” Here, the outer layer is the square root, wrapped around \\(3x^2 + 1\\). Differentiate each part Differentiate the outer function with respect to its input \\(u\\): \\[ f&#39;(u) = \\frac{d}{du}(u^{1/2}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}u^{-1/2}. \\] This says: the slope of the square root gets smaller as \\(u\\) gets bigger. Differentiate the inner function with respect to \\(x\\): \\[ u&#39; = \\frac{d}{dx}(3x^2+1) = 6x. \\] The inner part is just a polynomial; its slope grows linearly with \\(x\\). Apply the Chain Rule The Chain Rule says: \\[ \\frac{df}{dx} = f&#39;(u)\\cdot u&#39;. \\] Substitute our results: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\Big(\\tfrac{1}{2}(3x^2+1)^{-1/2}\\Big)\\cdot (6x). \\] Interpretation: take the derivative of the square root as if it were just \\(u\\), then multiply by how fast the inside (\\(3x^2+1\\)) is changing. Simplify the expression Multiply constants: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{6x}{2}(3x^2+1)^{-1/2}. \\] Reduce the fraction: \\[ f&#39;(x) = 3x(3x^2+1)^{-1/2}. \\] Rewrite the negative exponent as a square root: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{3x}{\\sqrt{3x^2+1}}. \\] Takeaway: The Chain Rule is about peeling off the outer layer, differentiating it, and then multiplying by how fast the inner layer changes. Without the inner derivative, the answer will always be incomplete. 4.6.4 Example 2: Environmental Application Suppose the water temperature in a stream increases due to sunlight exposure over time, and the rate of fish metabolism \\(M\\) depends on that temperature: Temperature: \\(T(t) = 10 + 5\\sin(t)\\) (base temperature of 10°C plus daily/seasonal fluctuations of ±5°C modeled by a sine wave) Metabolism: \\(M(T) = e^{0.2T}\\) (exponential relationship between metabolism and temperature, as often seen in biological processes) So the composite function is: \\[ M(t) = e^{0.2(10 + 5\\sin(t))}. \\] We want to differentiate \\(M(t)\\) with respect to time \\(t\\) to see how quickly fish metabolism is changing over time. 4.6.4.1 Step-by-Step Process Label inner and outer functions Inner function: \\[ u = 10 + 5\\sin(t) \\] This is the temperature as a function of time. Outer function: \\[ M(u) = e^{0.2u} \\] This is the metabolism as a function of temperature. Always start by peeling back the layers: first the sine-based temperature change (inner), then the exponential response (outer). Differentiate each part Outer derivative: \\[ \\frac{dM}{du} = 0.2e^{0.2u} \\] This says that metabolism increases at a rate proportional to its current level—classic exponential growth. Inner derivative: \\[ \\frac{du}{dt} = 5\\cos(t) \\] The rate of temperature change depends on the cosine curve: steepest at midpoints of the sine wave (sunrise/sunset) and flat at peaks/troughs (midday/night). Apply the Chain Rule Combine the pieces: \\[ M&#39;(t) = \\frac{dM}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dt} = 0.2e^{0.2(10 + 5\\sin(t))} \\cdot 5\\cos(t). \\] This formula captures two processes at once: the exponential sensitivity of metabolism to temperature and the sinusoidal fluctuation of temperature with time. Simplify the expression Multiply constants: \\[ M&#39;(t) = e^{0.2(10 + 5\\sin(t))} \\cdot \\cos(t).\\\\ M&#39;(t) = e^{2 + \\sin(t)} \\cdot \\cos(t).\\\\ \\] Notice how cleanly the constants combine—the factor of \\(0.2\\) and the \\(5\\) become a neat multiplier of \\(1\\). The result shows metabolism change is driven by both the direction of temperature change (sign of \\(\\cos t\\)) and the magnitude of metabolism (the exponential). 4.6.5 Interpretation When \\(\\cos(t) &gt; 0\\): temperature is rising, so metabolism is increasing. When \\(\\cos(t) &lt; 0\\): temperature is falling, so metabolism is decreasing. When \\(\\cos(t) = 0\\): temperature is at its peak or trough, so metabolism is momentarily changing at rate zero (flat slope). This matches ecological intuition: metabolism accelerates most when temperature is changing quickly, and stabilizes when temperature is near extremes. Takeaway: This example shows why the Chain Rule is essential in environmental modeling, variables rarely depend on time directly. Instead, they depend on other variables (like temperature), which themselves depend on time or other drivers. The Chain Rule is how we connect all the links in the chain. 4.6.6 Summary The Chain Rule is used when one function is inside another—a composite function. Step 1: Identify the outer function and the inner function. Step 2: Differentiate each one. Step 3: Multiply them together: (outer derivative, evaluated at the inner) × (inner derivative). In plain terms: differentiate layer by layer. This happens constantly in real-world systems, where one variable depends on another that is also changing. 4.7 Implicit Differentiation In calculus, Implicit Differentiation is used when a function is not given explicitly as \\(y = f(x)\\), but rather when \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are entangled in an equation. This happens often in environmental systems—where variables are linked through physical laws or conservation relationships rather than simple functions. The key idea: When differentiating an equation involving both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), treat \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\) (even if you can’t solve for it directly), and apply the Chain Rule whenever you differentiate a term involving \\(y\\). 4.7.1 When Do We Need Implicit Differentiation? Some relationships between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are too complicated to rewrite as \\(y = f(x)\\). For example: \\[ x^2 + y^2 = 25 \\] describes a circle. There’s no single function \\(y = f(x)\\) because each \\(x\\) corresponds to two \\(y\\) values (above and below the axis). Still, we can find the slope of the curve \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) by differentiating both sides with respect to \\(x\\) while remembering that \\(y\\) depends on \\(x\\). 4.7.2 Why Does It Work? Imagine you’re measuring depth and temperature at a point in a lake. The two are linked by complex physical processes—pressure increases with depth, light penetration decreases, and mixing layers between warm surface water and cool bottom water shift with the weather. Because of all these intertwined effects, there’s no simple formula like \\(T = f(D)\\) that perfectly describes temperature as a function of depth. Yet, we know that a small change in depth causes a small change in temperature—perhaps a few tenths of a degree per meter depending on the thermocline. Even if we can’t explicitly solve for \\(T(D)\\), we can still ask: how fast does temperature change with depth right here? To find that rate, we take the derivative of the relationship itself, even if \\(T\\) and \\(D\\) appear together in an equation like \\[ F(D, T) = 0. \\] When we differentiate both sides with respect to \\(D\\), we apply the Chain Rule to any term involving \\(T\\), because \\(T\\) changes as \\(D\\) changes. This is exactly what implicit differentiation does—it formalizes how we compute slopes and sensitivities in systems where variables are intertwined by physical laws rather than expressed as neat functions. It lets us answer questions like, “If I go 1 m deeper, how much colder does the water get?” without ever needing to untangle \\(T\\) as a direct function of \\(D\\). 4.7.3 Step-by-Step Example Differentiate both sides of: \\[ x^2 + y^2 = 25 \\] Differentiate each term with respect to \\(x\\) \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) + \\frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = \\frac{d}{dx}(25) \\] Apply the derivatives For \\(x^2\\), the derivative is straightforward: \\(2x\\). For \\(y^2\\), apply the Chain Rule since \\(y\\) depends on \\(x\\): \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}. \\] The derivative of a constant is zero. So: \\[ 2x + 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0 \\] Solve for \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) \\[ 2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = -2x \\] \\[ \\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x}{y} \\] Interpretation: The slope of the circle at any point \\((x, y)\\) is the negative ratio of \\(x\\) to \\(y\\). At the top (\\(x=0, y=5\\)), the slope is \\(0\\) (horizontal tangent). At the side (\\(x=5, y=0\\)), the slope is undefined (vertical tangent). 4.7.4 Conceptual Analogy: Contour Lines on a Map The Contour Map Analogy Imagine standing on a topographic map — the kind that shows lines of equal elevation, called contours. Each line represents all the points \\((x, y)\\) where the elevation \\(E(x, y)\\) is the same — for example, \\(E(x, y) = 25\\) meters. That’s an implicit relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\): you don’t have elevation written as “\\(y = f(x)\\)” or “\\(x = f(y)\\)”. Instead, both variables are connected through the condition that elevation stays constant. Now imagine walking along one of those contour lines. If you take a small step eastward (a change in \\(x\\)), you’ll also need to move slightly north or south (a change in \\(y\\)) to stay on the same contour — that is, to keep the elevation \\(E(x, y)\\) constant. That small “north/south adjustment” per unit “eastward step” is exactly what \\[ \\frac{dy}{dx} \\] measures. It tells you how \\(y\\) must change when \\(x\\) changes to keep the overall relationship \\(E(x, y) = \\text{constant}\\) true. So, just like tracing a contour line: - \\(E(x, y)\\) is the fixed relationship (like \\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\\)). - As you move in \\(x\\), \\(y\\) must adjust to stay on that curve. - The ratio of those small changes — \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) — is what implicit differentiation gives you. Takeaway: Implicit differentiation is like walking along a contour line — you can’t separate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), but you can still describe how one must change to keep the relationship balanced. 4.7.5 Environmental Application Let’s look at a simple model of carbon balance in a forest canopy: \\[ A(T, L) = k (T - 5)(L - 100) \\] where - \\(A\\) = net photosynthetic assimilation rate, - \\(T\\) = temperature (°C), - \\(L\\) = light intensity (μmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹), - \\(k\\) = scaling constant. Suppose the system maintains a constant assimilation rate, \\(A = A_0\\). That means \\(A(T, L) = A_0\\) defines an implicit curve between \\(T\\) and \\(L\\): as temperature rises, light must adjust to keep assimilation fixed. Differentiate both sides with respect to \\(T\\): \\[ \\frac{d}{dT}\\big[ k (T - 5)(L - 100) \\big] = 0. \\] Apply the Product Rule and Chain Rule \\[ k[(L - 100) + (T - 5)\\frac{dL}{dT}] = 0 \\] Simplify and solve for \\(\\frac{dL}{dT}\\) \\[ (L - 100) + (T - 5)\\frac{dL}{dT} = 0 \\] \\[ \\frac{dL}{dT} = -\\frac{L - 100}{T - 5} \\] Interpretation: To keep carbon assimilation constant, light intensity must decrease as temperature rises (negative slope), and the magnitude of that adjustment depends on how far \\(T\\) and \\(L\\) are from their baseline values (5°C and 100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹). 4.7.6 Step-by-Step Summary Implicit Differentiation is used when \\(y\\) (or another variable) can’t be isolated easily. Step 1: Differentiate both sides with respect to \\(x\\). Step 2: Apply the Chain Rule to any term containing \\(y\\). Step 3: Solve for \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\). In words: differentiate everything, then untangle for the slope. 4.7.7 Key Takeaway Implicit differentiation extends the Chain Rule to relationships that can’t be untangled into a single function. It’s the calculus tool for understanding how interconnected variables co-adjust—essential for studying feedbacks and constraints in environmental systems. 4.8 Practice: Basic Derivative Rules 4.8.1 Skill Drills — Build Comfort Through Repetition When you first learned multiplication tables, you didn’t stop after doing one or two — you practiced until you could recall them without thinking. Derivatives work the same way. The goal here isn’t to memorize answers, but to train your brain to recognize patterns and apply the right rule automatically. The faster and more confidently you can work with the basic derivative rules — constant, power, constant multiple, sum/difference, exponentials, logarithms, and simple trigonometric derivatives — the more mental bandwidth you’ll have later for tackling bigger problems involving multiple rules, chain rule, or real-world applications. These problems are your reps in the derivative gym. Work through them steadily, write each step, and check your answers. Over time, your speed and accuracy will improve without you even noticing. Instructions: Differentiate each function using only the basic derivative rules (no product, quotient, or chain rules needed). \\(f(x) = 7\\) \\(g(x) = x^5\\) \\(h(x) = -3x^{-2}\\) \\(p(t) = \\sqrt{t}\\) \\(q(s) = \\dfrac{1}{s^3}\\) \\(r(x) = 4x^7 - 5x + 2\\) \\(m(y) = -\\dfrac{1}{2}y^{4} + 7y^{2}\\) \\(n(z) = 12e^{z}\\) \\(k(x) = e^{-5x}\\) \\(P(t) = \\ln t\\) \\(Q(r) = 5\\ln r - 2r\\) \\(R(\\theta) = \\sin\\theta\\) \\(S(\\theta) = \\cos\\theta\\) \\(T(x) = -\\tan x\\) \\(U(s) = 9s^{1/3} - 4s^{-1/2}\\) \\(V(t) = 6e^{3t} - 10\\) \\(W(x) = 0.1x^{4} + 0.25x^{-3}\\) \\(X(y) = 2\\sin y - 3\\cos y\\) \\(Y(x) = 4e^{x} + \\ln x\\) \\(Z(\\theta) = 5\\theta^{2} - 7\\sin\\theta + e^{\\theta}\\) \\(f(x) = -11\\) \\(g(x) = 15x\\) \\(h(t) = t^{10}\\) \\(p(s) = -4s^{-4}\\) \\(q(y) = \\sqrt[3]{y}\\) \\(r(x) = \\dfrac{7}{x^5}\\) \\(m(z) = z^{1/2} - z^{-1/2}\\) \\(n(t) = 0.5t^{8} - 3t^{3} + 2t\\) \\(k(x) = -\\tfrac{1}{4}x^{-6} + 9x^{2}\\) \\(P(t) = 100e^{t}\\) \\(Q(r) = e^{-0.2r}\\) \\(R(\\theta) = \\ln \\theta\\) \\(S(x) = -6\\ln x + 8x\\) \\(T(t) = \\sin t\\) \\(U(\\theta) = -\\cos\\theta\\) \\(V(x) = 12\\tan x\\) \\(W(s) = s^{3/4} + 4s^{-2/3}\\) \\(X(t) = -0.3t^{5} + 2.5t^{-4}\\) \\(Y(y) = 9e^{7y} - 12\\) \\(Z(x) = e^{-4x} + e^{5x}\\) \\(A(u) = 2\\sin u + 3\\cos u\\) \\(B(\\theta) = -\\sin\\theta - \\cos\\theta\\) \\(C(x) = 7x^{9} + \\tfrac{1}{3}x^{-9}\\) \\(D(t) = -8e^{2t} + 5e^{-t}\\) \\(E(s) = \\ln s - 4e^{s}\\) \\(F(y) = 3y^{0.5} - 4y^{2.5}\\) \\(G(x) = x^{7/3} - 5x^{-7/3}\\) \\(H(z) = 0.01z^{5} + 12z^{-5}\\) \\(J(t) = 2\\sin t - 0.5\\tan t\\) \\(K(x) = e^{x} + \\ln x - x^{4}\\) 4.9 Practice: Product &amp; Quotient Rules Up until now, we’ve only differentiated expressions built from single terms or simple sums. But in real problems, functions are often multiplied or divided — and the basic power, exponential, or trig rules aren’t enough. That’s where the product rule and quotient rule come in: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\big[ f(x)g(x) \\big] = f&#39;(x)g(x) + f(x)g&#39;(x) \\] \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\right] = \\frac{f&#39;(x)g(x) - f(x)g&#39;(x)}{\\big[g(x)\\big]^2} \\] Tips for success: 1. Identify which rule applies by looking at the top level of the function: product or quotient. 2. Differentiate one part at a time, keeping the other part unchanged. 3. Use parentheses generously — they protect you from sign and order mistakes. Instructions: Differentiate each function. Apply the product or quotient rule as needed. Use other basic rules inside as appropriate. \\(f(x) = (x^3+2)(x^2-5)\\) \\(g(t) = t^4 e^{t}\\) \\(h(x) = \\sin x \\cdot \\ln x\\) \\(p(z) = (3z^{-2} - 5)(z^4 + 1)\\) \\(q(t) = \\dfrac{t^3 + 4}{t^2 - 1}\\) \\(r(x) = \\dfrac{\\ln x}{x^3}\\) \\(s(\\theta) = \\dfrac{\\sin\\theta}{e^{\\theta}}\\) \\(u(y) = (y^2+1)(e^{-2y})\\) \\(v(x) = \\dfrac{e^{x} + x}{\\sqrt{x}}\\) \\(w(t) = \\dfrac{\\cos t}{1+t^2}\\) \\(m(x) = (5x^2 - 4x + 1)(x^{-3})\\) \\(n(t) = \\dfrac{t e^{t}}{t^2+1}\\) \\(k(y) = (y^3+2y)\\sin y\\) \\(P(r) = \\dfrac{1 + \\ln r}{r}\\) \\(Q(\\theta) = \\dfrac{\\cos(2\\theta)}{\\theta^4}\\) \\(R(z) = (z^5 - z)\\,e^{-z}\\) \\(S(x) = \\dfrac{x^2+1}{e^{3x}}\\) \\(T(t) = (4t^{-1} + t^2)(\\ln t)\\) \\(U(y) = \\dfrac{\\sin y + y^2}{\\cos y}\\) \\(V(x) = \\dfrac{x e^{x}}{x-5}\\) 4.10 Practice: Chain Rule Practice Sometimes a function isn’t just one clean layer — it’s a function inside another function. That’s when you use the chain rule. It tells us: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = f&#39;(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x) \\] Think of it as peeling an onion: 1. Differentiate the outer function first (leave the inside unchanged). 2. Multiply by the derivative of the inner function. Tips for success: - Always identify the inner and outer function before you start. - Parentheses are your friend — they keep track of what’s “inside.” - Don’t forget the inner derivative — that’s the most common mistake! Instructions: Differentiate each function using the chain rule. Apply other basic rules inside as needed. \\(f(x) = (3x+2)^{5}\\) \\(g(t) = \\sqrt{5t^2 - 4}\\) \\(h(z) = \\ln(4z^3 - z)\\) \\(p(y) = e^{2y - y^2}\\) \\(q(\\theta) = \\sin(7\\theta - 3)\\) \\(r(x) = \\cos(x^4 + 1)\\) \\(s(t) = \\tan(5t)\\) \\(u(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x^2 + 4x - 1}\\) \\(v(z) = e^{\\sin z}\\) \\(w(r) = \\ln\\!\\big(\\sqrt{r^2+9}\\big)\\) 4.11 Practice: Mixed Rules — Putting It All Together So far, you’ve practiced each rule on its own: - Basic rules for powers, exponentials, logs, and trig. - Product and quotient rules for multiplication and division. - Chain rule for nested functions. But real functions — especially in environmental science models — rarely come neatly packaged for a single rule. You might have to use the product rule on the outside and the chain rule inside, or start with the quotient rule and then use a basic rule on each term. This section helps you get comfortable choosing and combining rules. The goal isn’t speed — it’s knowing how to break the problem down into manageable steps. Instructions: Differentiate each function. Identify which rules you are using at each step. \\(f(x) = (x^2+1) \\cdot e^{3x^2}\\) \\(g(t) = \\dfrac{\\ln(1+t^2)}{t^3}\\) \\(h(z) = e^{-2z} \\cdot \\sin(z^2)\\) \\(p(y) = \\dfrac{e^{5y}}{\\sqrt{y^2+4}}\\) \\(q(\\theta) = (\\sin\\theta)(\\cos(2\\theta))\\) \\(r(x) = \\dfrac{x^3+1}{e^{x^2}}\\) \\(s(t) = (t^2+3t+1)^{4} \\cdot \\ln t\\) \\(u(x) = \\dfrac{\\sin(3x)}{\\ln(x^2+1)}\\) \\(v(r) = (r^2-4)^{-3} \\cdot e^{-r}\\) \\(w(z) = \\dfrac{e^{\\sin z} + z^2}{\\sqrt{\\tan z}}\\) 4.12 Practice: Implicit Differentiation Sometimes equations involve both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) mixed together — not neatly written as \\(y = f(x)\\). That’s when you use implicit differentiation. It allows you to find \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) even when you can’t easily solve for \\(y\\). The idea is simple: Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to \\(x\\), treating \\(y\\) as a function of \\(x\\). Whenever you take the derivative of a term involving \\(y\\), multiply by \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) — because \\(y\\) changes as \\(x\\) changes. \\[ \\text{If } y = y(x), \\quad \\frac{d}{dx}[y^n] = n y^{n-1} \\frac{dy}{dx} \\] Think of it like a ripple effect: when \\(x\\) changes, \\(y\\) changes too, and you must account for both. Tips for success: - Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to \\(x\\). - Every time you take the derivative of a \\(y\\)-term, multiply by \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\). - After differentiating, collect all terms with \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) on one side and solve for it. - Keep parentheses clear — they’ll help you organize the equation. Instructions: Differentiate each equation implicitly with respect to \\(x\\). Solve for \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) where possible. \\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\\) \\(xy = 6\\) \\(x^3 + y^3 = 9xy\\) \\(\\sin(xy) = x\\) \\(e^{x+y} = x^2\\) \\(\\ln(x^2 + y^2) = 3x\\) \\(x^2y + xy^2 = 10\\) \\(\\cos(y) = x^2 + 1\\) \\(y^2 + e^y = x\\) \\(x^2 + xy + y^2 = 7\\) Takeaway: Implicit differentiation helps you find \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) when \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are intertwined in the same equation. Differentiate everything, apply the Chain Rule to \\(y\\), then untangle to isolate \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\). 4.13 Practice: Applications — Derivatives in Environmental Models The functions you’ll encounter in environmental science are often built from multiple mathematical pieces: - Seasonal variation (trig) - Long-term trends (polynomials, exponentials) - Constraints (rational functions) - Response curves (logistic models) These rarely fit into a single derivative rule — instead, they combine product, quotient, and chain rules. In each of these problems, focus on interpreting the derivative in terms of the situation after you compute it. Instructions: For each problem: (a) Define variables and units clearly. (b) Differentiate the given function. (c) Interpret \\(f&#39;(x)\\) in context. 1. Wetland Nutrient Uptake (logistic response) \\[ N(t) = \\frac{80}{1 + 5e^{-0.4t}} \\] - Find \\(N&#39;(t)\\). - Explain what the sign of \\(N&#39;(t)\\) indicates about nutrient removal over time. 2. Atmospheric Pollutant Decline (trend × decay) \\[ M(t) = (200 - 3t)\\,e^{-0.05t} \\] - Find \\(M&#39;(t)\\). - Interpret \\(M&#39;(50)\\) (tonnes/day) after 50 days. 3. Reservoir Water Level (quotient with root) \\[ H(t) = \\frac{100 + 4t}{\\sqrt{t+1}} \\] - Find \\(H&#39;(t)\\). - Interpret \\(H&#39;(10)\\) for dam release planning. 4. Tree Growth with Resource Limitation (saturating growth) \\[ h(t) = 25\\left(1 - e^{-0.2t}\\right) \\] - Find \\(h&#39;(t)\\). - Describe how \\(h&#39;(t)\\) evolves as the tree matures. 5. Seasonal River Inflow (single trig component) \\[ Q(t) = \\big(120 + 18\\sin\\!\\tfrac{2\\pi t}{12}\\big)\\,e^{-0.03t} \\] - Find \\(Q&#39;(t)\\). - Explain how the seasonal term vs. the decay term influence \\(Q&#39;(t)\\) in the short run and long run.

These points often represent tipping points, thresholds, or limits that define how natural systems respond to change. For example: What is the maximum population an ecosystem can support before resources become limiting? When is the lowest point of atmospheric CO₂ during a seasonal cycle? At what point in time does a lake’s temperature reach its annual peak? How much rainfall leads to the maximum runoff in a watershed? When does a species’ growth rate slow down as competition increases? Each of these questions asks about extrema — the points where something stops increasing and starts decreasing (a maximum) or stops decreasing and starts increasing (a minimum). 5.1.1 Why Extremes Matter In environmental systems, extrema are rarely just mathematical curiosities. They often mark ecological thresholds or critical transitions where a system shifts from one state to another. A maximum might signal the carrying capacity of a population or the peak of a pollution event. A minimum could correspond to the lowest nutrient level needed to sustain life or the point of greatest drought intensity. Understanding these points helps scientists predict, manage, and mitigate changes in ecosystems. 5.1.2 The Mathematical Lens From a mathematical perspective, these questions are all about the shape of a function — how it rises and falls. When a function reaches a peak or valley, its graph changes direction. At that turning point, the slope of the tangent line becomes zero. That’s where derivatives come in. A derivative measures how fast something is changing — the slope of the function at any given point. When the derivative is positive, the function is increasing. When it is negative, the function is decreasing. When it equals zero, the function is neither rising nor falling — it’s level — and that’s where we look for potential extrema. 5.1.3 The Big Idea Derivatives act as a mathematical microscope: they let us zoom in on how a function behaves locally — whether it’s climbing, falling, or flattening out. By finding where the derivative equals zero (or is undefined), we identify critical points — the likely spots for maxima or minima. From there, we use the sign of the derivative (and sometimes the second derivative) to determine whether each point is a peak, valley, or inflection in the system. 5.1.4 Environmental Interpretation In practice, this process might mean: Identifying the time when a glacier’s melt rate switches from accelerating to slowing. Finding the nutrient concentration that maximizes algal growth before it declines due to self-shading. Determining the temperature where enzyme activity in a soil process is optimal. In all these cases, calculus provides the same insight: the moment where change stops changing direction — a snapshot of balance in a dynamic world. 5.2 Understanding Maximums and Minimums Before we dive deeper into finding extrema, let’s clarify what we actually mean by maximums and minimums — and the difference between local and global extremes. 5.2.1 What Is a Maximum? A maximum is a point where the function reaches its highest value — either within a small region or across its entire domain. Local (Relative) Maximum: A point where the function is higher than nearby points. Think of it as a small hilltop on a larger landscape. Mathematically, \\(f(a)\\) is a local maximum if: \\[ f(a) \\ge f(x) \\quad \\text{for all } x \\text{ near } a \\] Global (Absolute) Maximum: The single highest point on the entire graph. Mathematically, \\(f(a)\\) is a global maximum if: \\[ f(a) \\ge f(x) \\quad \\text{for every } x \\text{ in the domain} \\] Example: In a year-long temperature record, the hottest day of the year is the global maximum, while the warmest day in each month would be local maxima. 5.2.2 What Is a Minimum? A minimum is a point where the function reaches its lowest value. Local (Relative) Minimum: A point where the function is lower than nearby points — a small valley in the landscape. \\[ f(a) \\le f(x) \\quad \\text{for all } x \\text{ near } a \\] Global (Absolute) Minimum: The lowest point across the entire function. \\[ f(a) \\le f(x) \\quad \\text{for every } x \\text{ in the domain} \\] Example: For a river’s flow rate, the lowest discharge of the year is a global minimum, while each dip between storms is a local minimum. 5.2.3 Global Extrema and Finite Domains When a function is defined only over a finite interval — for example, \\(a \\le x \\le b\\) — the global maximum or minimum can occur at the endpoints as well as at interior critical points. That means you must always check the function’s boundaries when finding global extrema. Sometimes, the highest or lowest value of a system happens right at the edge of the range you’re studying. Example: If we model daily solar radiation between sunrise and sunset, the minimum radiation occurs at sunrise and sunset — the endpoints of the domain. 5.2.4 Visualizing Local vs. Global Extrema Imagine hiking through a mountain range: Each hilltop you reach is a local maximum. The tallest mountain of all is the global maximum. Each valley floor between peaks is a local minimum. The deepest valley overall is the global minimum. If your hike starts and ends in a valley, those endpoints might also mark global extrema — even if no peak lies between. 5.2.5 What each panel illustrates: Panel Function Concept Highlighted A \\(f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2\\) Typical local max and min inside the domain B \\(f(x) = -(x - 3)^2 + 5\\) over \\([0,6]\\) Global extrema at endpoints C \\(f(x) = x^3\\) Flat point with \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) but no extremum D \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\) Repeating local maxima/minima in periodic behavior 5.2.6 Why the Difference Matters When analyzing environmental data — like temperature, population, or rainfall — it’s often the local extrema that show short-term cycles or seasonal variation, while global extrema reveal long-term limits or absolute thresholds. For instance: The local maximum in CO₂ each year reflects seasonal plant activity. The global maximum shows the all-time record high in atmospheric concentration. In summary: - Local extrema describe regional or temporary highs and lows. - Global extrema describe the overall highest or lowest points in a dataset or model. - On a finite domain, global extrema can occur at the endpoints as well as where \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\). Both are found using the same calculus tools — derivatives — but interpreted in different ways depending on the system’s context. 5.3 The Idea Every smooth curve tells a story about change. When a function reaches a peak (a high point) or a valley (a low point), its direction of change reverses — from increasing to decreasing, or vice versa. These turning points mark moments where something important happens: the system pauses before shifting course. Mathematically, this change in direction shows up in the slope of the function. The derivative, \\(f&#39;(x)\\), measures that slope — how fast the function is increasing or decreasing at any given point. When \\(f&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\), the slope is positive → the function is rising. When \\(f&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\), the slope is negative → the function is falling. When \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\), the slope is flat → the function is level. At a peak or valley, the tangent line to the curve flattens out — it’s neither rising nor falling. That’s why these special points occur when: \\[ f&#39;(x) = 0 \\] These are called critical points, and they are the candidates for extreme values — places where a maximum or minimum might occur. 5.3.1 Visualizing the Idea Imagine hiking through a mountain landscape: When you’re climbing, the slope beneath your feet is positive — you’re going up. When you’re descending, the slope is negative — you’re going down. At the summit, for just a moment, the ground feels level — your slope is zero. That’s the mathematical equivalent of \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\). Similarly, in environmental systems: The point when a river’s discharge stops rising after a storm marks a maximum. The moment when CO₂ concentration stops falling in spring marks a minimum. These transitions — from increasing to decreasing or vice versa — are what we call extrema. 5.3.2 Why “Critical Points” Aren’t Always Extremes Finding where \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) is an important step, but it doesn’t automatically mean the function has a maximum or minimum there. A zero slope simply means the tangent line is flat — the function could be turning around or continuing in the same direction. 5.3.2.1 When Flat Doesn’t Mean Peak or Valley Sometimes the derivative equals zero, but the function just keeps going up or down. Consider the function: \\[ f(x) = x^3 \\] Its derivative is: \\[ f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 \\] Here, \\(f&#39;(0) = 0\\), so \\(x = 0\\) is a critical point. But if you graph \\(f(x) = x^3\\), you’ll see that the curve flattens briefly at the origin, then continues increasing. There’s no maximum or minimum — the function simply changes concavity (the direction it bends). 5.3.2.2 What This Means Setting \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) identifies potential extrema, not guaranteed ones. To determine what kind of point it is, we need more information about the function’s behavior near that location. We can use: A first derivative sign chart to see if the slope changes from positive → negative (maximum) or negative → positive (minimum). Or the second derivative test, which checks whether the curve bends upward or downward at that point. 5.3.2.3 Key Takeaways A critical point is where \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) or \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is undefined. A true extremum occurs only if the function changes direction there. Use derivative sign changes or concavity to tell the difference. In short: Solving \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) gives us the candidates for maxima and minima — further analysis confirms which ones truly are. 5.3.3 Environmental Example In population ecology, imagine a species whose population \\(P(t)\\) grows rapidly at first but slows down as resources become limited. If we graph \\(P(t)\\) over time, the population might climb to a maximum before leveling off or declining. At that turning point, the rate of growth — the derivative \\(P&#39;(t)\\) — equals zero. Finding that zero slope helps us identify the moment of ecological balance, where birth rates equal death rates and the system momentarily stabilizes. In short, extrema mark the balance points of change, and the derivative is our tool for detecting them. By finding where the slope becomes zero, we uncover where a system pauses, pivots, or peaks — the fingerprints of dynamic processes across environmental systems. 5.4 Step-by-Step: Finding Extrema When we want to find where a function reaches its highest or lowest point, we follow a logical, repeatable process. You can think of this as a “recipe” for finding turning points — it always works, no matter how complicated the function. 5.4.1 The Four-Step Process Take the derivative of the function. → This gives you a formula for the slope (how fast the function is changing). Find critical points by solving \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) (or where \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is undefined). → These are possible peaks or valleys. Use a sign chart or second derivative to classify each critical point. → This tells you whether each point is a maximum, minimum, or neither. Evaluate the function at those points. → This gives the actual values of the extremes (the “how high” or “how low”). 5.5 Step 1: Take the Derivative To begin, take the derivative of your function \\(f(x)\\). This tells you the rate of change — how fast \\(f(x)\\) is rising or falling at each point. If you imagine the graph of your function as a landscape: The slope of the function tells you whether you’re climbing uphill (positive slope) or going downhill (negative slope). At a peak or valley, the slope flattens out — the hill levels before changing direction. That’s why extrema occur when the derivative equals zero. 5.5.1 How to Differentiate Apply the derivative rules you already know: Rule Type Example Derivative Power Rule \\(x^n\\) \\(n x^{n-1}\\) Sum Rule \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x) + g&#39;(x)\\) Product Rule \\(f(x)g(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x)g(x) + f(x)g&#39;(x)\\) Quotient Rule \\(\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\) \\(\\frac{f&#39;(x)g(x) - f(x)g&#39;(x)}{g(x)^2}\\) Chain Rule \\(f(g(x))\\) \\(f&#39;(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x)\\) Tip: Always rewrite the function cleanly before differentiating — simplify fractions, expand products, and identify which rule(s) you’ll need. 5.5.2 What You’re Looking For You’re not differentiating just to practice — you’re looking for turning points, where the slope might change sign. These are the potential peaks or valleys of the system, the places where growth stops and reversal begins. Once you have \\(f&#39;(x)\\), the next task is to find where it equals zero. 5.6 Step 2: Find the Critical Points A critical point is any point on the function where: \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\), or \\(f&#39;(x)\\) does not exist (but \\(f(x)\\) does). These are the places where the function might reach a maximum or minimum. 5.6.1 Why Set the Derivative to Zero? At a peak or valley, the tangent line to the curve is flat — no uphill or downhill slope — meaning: \\[ f&#39;(x) = 0 \\] That’s the condition we solve to find potential extrema. 5.6.2 How to Solve \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) Depending on your derivative, different algebraic tools work best: Factoring: The fastest approach if possible. Example: \\(f&#39;(x) = 3x(x - 2) = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 0, 2\\) Quadratic Formula: Use if \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is quadratic and doesn’t factor nicely: \\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\] Graph or numerical methods: If the equation is more complicated (exponential, trigonometric, higher-order), use a graphing tool like Desmos, R, or a calculator to approximate roots. Note: Sometimes \\(f&#39;(x)\\) might be undefined (like with absolute value functions). Those points can also be critical points if \\(f(x)\\) itself is still defined there. 5.6.3 Quick Example If \\(f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 1\\), then \\(f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9\\). Setting \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) gives \\(3(x^2 - 4x + 3) = 0\\) Factoring give us \\((x - 1)(x - 3) = 0\\). So \\(x = 1, 3\\) are our critical points. Now we need to determine what kind of points they are. 5.7 Step 3: Classify Each Critical Point Using a Sign Chart Once you’ve found the critical points, the next question is: “Is this point a peak, a valley, or just a flat spot?” To answer that, we use a sign chart — a simple, visual way to test how the slope behaves around each critical point. 5.7.1 How to Build a First Derivative Sign Chart Factor the derivative (if possible). This makes it easy to check the signs of each factor. Mark the critical points on a number line. They divide the number line into intervals. Choose a test value in each interval. Substitute it into \\(f&#39;(x)\\) to check the sign (positive or negative). Record the results. If \\(f&#39;(x)\\) changes from + → –, it’s a local maximum. If \\(f&#39;(x)\\) changes from – → +, it’s a local minimum. If there’s no sign change, it’s not an extreme point (could be an inflection). 5.7.1.1 Example Table Interval Test Value Sign of \\(f&#39;(x)\\) Function Behavior Result Left of \\(x=1\\) 0 \\(+\\) Increasing Between \\(1\\) and \\(3\\) 2 \\(-\\) Decreasing Max at \\(x=1\\) Right of \\(x=3\\) 4 \\(+\\) Increasing Min at \\(x=3\\) 5.7.2 Visualizing the Sign Chart You can think of the sign chart as a slope “map”: \\(+\\) means the function rises (↗️) \\(-\\) means it falls (↘️) A change in direction marks a turning point This method is powerful because it shows why maxima and minima occur. 5.8 Step 4: Evaluate the Function at the Critical Points Now that you know which points are maxima or minima, you can find their actual heights or depths by plugging those \\(x\\)-values back into the original function \\(f(x)\\). For each critical point \\(x_i\\): \\[ y_i = f(x_i) \\] These \\((x_i, y_i)\\) pairs are your extrema coordinates. 5.8.1 How to Interpret the Results Type Behavior Example Interpretation Local Maximum Function rises then falls Peak temperature or maximum biomass Local Minimum Function falls then rises Lowest CO₂ concentration or drought minimum Neither Function flattens but continues Inflection in trend or temporary slowdown Tip: Always check whether your extrema are local (within a neighborhood) or global (the absolute highest or lowest value on the domain). 5.8.2 Putting It All Together By following these steps, you can analyze any smooth function systematically: Step What You Do What It Tells You 1. Differentiate Find \\(f&#39;(x)\\) The rate of change 2. Set \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) Solve for \\(x\\) Potential turning points 3. Sign chart or \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) test Check slope behavior Identify max/min 4. Evaluate \\(f(x)\\) Get actual values How high or low the extremes are 5.8.3 Environmental Perspective In environmental modeling, this process might look like: Finding when a river flow rate peaks after rainfall (maximum). Determining the lowest temperature in a yearly cycle (minimum). Locating when a population growth curve levels off at carrying capacity (slope = 0). In all cases, derivatives let us move from observation (“the graph changes”) to quantification (“it changes where \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) and how much it changes around that point”). 5.9  Environmental Example: A Cubic Population Model Let’s explore how derivatives help us find maximum and minimum points using a realistic environmental example — a population that grows, stabilizes, and then declines due to changing conditions. 5.9.1 Step 0: The Model We’ll use this cubic population function: \\[ P(t) = -t^3 + 6t^2 - 9t + 20 \\] Here: \\(P(t)\\) represents population size at time \\(t\\) The negative cubic term (\\(-t^3\\)) eventually causes decline — simulating limits like competition, disease, or limited resources The middle terms model an initial growth phase before the downturn 5.9.2 Step 1: Find the First Derivative To determine when the population reaches a high point (maximum) or low point (minimum), we start by finding how the population is changing over time — its rate of change. This rate of change is given by the first derivative of the function \\(P(t)\\). Our model is: \\[ P(t) = -t^3 + 6t^2 - 9t + 20 \\] Apply the power rule to each term: Term Derivative \\(-t^3\\) \\(-3t^2\\) \\(6t^2\\) \\(12t\\) \\(-9t\\) \\(-9\\) \\(20\\) \\(0\\) (constants don’t change) Combine these results: \\[ P&#39;(t) = -3t^2 + 12t - 9 \\] 5.9.3 What the Derivative Tells Us \\(P&#39;(t) &gt; 0\\): the population is increasing (growth phase) \\(P&#39;(t) &lt; 0\\): the population is decreasing (decline phase) \\(P&#39;(t) = 0\\): the growth rate is zero — the population is neither rising nor falling These “flat slope” points are where the population might reach a maximum or minimum — the key turning points in its behavior. Next Step: Set \\(P&#39;(t) = 0\\) to find when the growth rate becomes zero. These values of \\(t\\) are called critical points, and they’re the candidates for the population’s peaks and valleys. 5.9.4 Step 2: Find the Critical Points Now that we have the derivative, we can find where the population stops increasing or decreasing — these are called critical points. Critical points occur where: The slope is zero (a flat or horizontal tangent line), or The derivative is undefined (sharp corners or cusps — we’ll explore those later) For this model, we set the derivative equal to zero: \\[ P&#39;(t) = -3t^2 + 12t - 9 = 0 \\] This is a quadratic equation, so we can solve it by factoring or using the quadratic formula. 5.9.4.1 Step 2a: Solve by Factoring First, simplify by dividing both sides by \\(-3\\): \\[ t^2 - 4t + 3 = 0 \\] Now factor: \\[ (t - 1)(t - 3) = 0 \\] So: \\[ t = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t = 3 \\] These are our critical points — times when the slope is zero and the population might reach a maximum or minimum. 5.9.4.2 Step 2b: Solving with the Quadratic Formula (if needed) If factoring doesn’t work, we can use the quadratic formula: \\[ t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\] For \\(P&#39;(t) = -3t^2 + 12t - 9\\): \\[ a = -3, \\quad b = 12, \\quad c = -9 \\] Substitute into the formula: \\[ t = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{(12)^2 - 4(-3)(-9)}}{2(-3)} = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 108}}{-6} \\] \\[ t = \\frac{-12 \\pm 6}{-6} \\] \\[ t = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t = 3 \\] 5.9.5 Interpretation The slope of \\(P(t)\\) becomes zero at \\(t = 1\\) and \\(t = 3\\) These are the critical times when the population stops changing direction. In the next step, we’ll determine which point is a maximum (peak population) and which is a minimum (lowest population) by examining the sign of the derivative around them. Key Idea: Critical points are where “change pauses.” The derivative equals zero, marking potential peaks or valleys in the system’s behavior. 5.9.6 Step 3: Construct a Sign Chart Now that we’ve found the critical points at \\(t = 1\\) and \\(t = 3\\), we can determine whether each one represents a maximum or a minimum. To do this, we analyze how the sign of the derivative changes around those points. 5.9.7 Why Use a Sign Chart? The first derivative tells us if the function is: Positive → the function is increasing (uphill) Negative → the function is decreasing (downhill) At a maximum, the slope changes from positive to negative. At a minimum, the slope changes from negative to positive. A sign chart helps us visualize these changes. 5.9.8 The Derivative (Factored Form) We’ll use the factored version of the derivative: \\[ P&#39;(t) = -3(t - 1)(t - 3) \\] Because it’s already factored, we can easily test the sign of each factor in different regions. 5.9.9 Step 3a: Divide the Number Line Mark the critical points on a number line. These divide the domain into three intervals: Interval A: \\((-\\infty, 1)\\) Interval B: \\((1, 3)\\) Interval C: \\((3, \\infty)\\) 5.9.10 Step 3b: Choose Test Points Next, pick one test value in each interval to check whether the derivative is positive or negative in that region. Remember, we only need one test point per interval — if the derivative’s sign is positive or negative at one point in an interval, it will have the same sign everywhere in that interval. Interval Test Point \\(t - 1\\) \\(t - 3\\) × \\(-3\\) Sign of \\(P&#39;(t)\\) Behavior of \\(P(t)\\) \\(t &lt; 1\\) 0 \\(-\\) \\(-\\) \\(-\\) Negative Decreasing \\(1 &lt; t &lt; 3\\) 2 \\(+\\) \\(-\\) \\(+\\) Positive Increasing \\(t &gt; 3\\) 4 \\(+\\) \\(+\\) \\(-\\) Negative Decreasing 5.9.11 Step 3c: Interpret the Signs Let’s translate what the sign chart tells us about the population’s behavior: For \\(t &lt; 1\\): \\(P&#39;(t) &lt; 0\\) → population is decreasing For \\(1 &lt; t &lt; 3\\): \\(P&#39;(t) &gt; 0\\) → population is increasing For \\(t &gt; 3\\): \\(P&#39;(t) &lt; 0\\) → population is decreasing again That means: At \\(t = 1\\), the slope changes from negative → positive → local minimum At \\(t = 3\\), the slope changes from positive → negative → local maximum 5.9.12 Step 3d: What the Signs Mean Change in \\(P&#39;(t)\\) What Happens to \\(P(t)\\) Type of Point \\(+ \\to -\\) Increasing → Decreasing Local Maximum \\(- \\to +\\) Decreasing → Increasing Local Minimum No sign change Same direction Not an Extremum 5.9.13 Step 3e: Key Takeaway The sign chart gives a simple, visual way to connect the derivative’s sign to the shape of the function. Positive slope → the function is going up. Negative slope → the function is going down. Sign changes → that’s where turning points (maxima or minima) occur. In summary: The population \\(P(t)\\) decreases, reaches a minimum at \\(t = 1\\), increases to a maximum at \\(t = 3\\), then begins to decrease again. The derivative’s sign tells the whole story of how the population grows and declines over time. 5.9.14 Step 4: Evaluate the Function Now that we’ve found the critical points at \\(t = 1\\) and \\(t = 3\\), let’s calculate the population values at those times by substituting them into the original function: \\[ P(t) = -t^3 + 6t^2 - 9t + 20 \\] 5.9.14.1 Evaluate at \\(t = 1\\) \\[ P(1) = -(1)^3 + 6(1)^2 - 9(1) + 20 \\] \\[ P(1) = -1 + 6 - 9 + 20 = 16 \\] 5.9.14.2 Evaluate at \\(t = 3\\) \\[ P(3) = -(3)^3 + 6(3)^2 - 9(3) + 20 \\] \\[ P(3) = -27 + 54 - 27 + 20 = 20 \\] 5.9.15 Step 4a: Interpret the Results \\(t\\) \\(P(t)\\) Type Description 1 16 Local Minimum Population reaches its lowest point before growing again 3 20 Local Maximum Population peaks before starting to decline So we can write our extrema as: \\[ \\text{Local Minimum: } (1, 16) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{Local Maximum: } (3, 20) \\] 5.9.16 Summary At \\(t = 1\\): Population = 16 → local minimum At \\(t = 3\\): Population = 20 → local maximum Between these points, the population decreases, then grows to a peak, and finally begins to decline — a pattern that mirrors how populations often respond to shifting environmental conditions. 5.9.17 Final Takeaways Work with the factored form of the derivative — it makes sign analysis quicker and more transparent. Test just one value per interval — if the derivative’s sign is positive or negative at one point, it’s the same throughout that entire region. Remember the leading coefficient — it can flip all the signs in your chart if it’s negative. The sign of \\(P&#39;(t)\\) tells you whether the function \\(P(t)\\) is increasing (positive slope) or decreasing (negative slope). Using a first derivative sign chart allows you to clearly determine whether each critical point represents a maximum, minimum, or neither — turning algebraic work into a visual map of how the system behaves. 5.10 Second Derivative Sign Charts: Understanding Concavity The first derivative tells us whether a function is increasing or decreasing. The second derivative goes one level deeper — it tells us how that rate of change itself is changing. In other words, it describes the curvature or shape of the function’s graph, also known as concavity. 5.10.0.1 Understanding Concavity Through Visual Examples This 2×2 panel shows how the second derivative helps us interpret the shape or curvature of a function. While the first derivative tells us whether a function is increasing or decreasing, the second derivative tells us how that rate of change itself is changing — in other words, the function’s concavity. Panel A – Standard Concavity Change (\\(f(x) = x^3\\)) The curve bends downward (red) for \\(x &lt; 0\\) and upward (blue) for \\(x &gt; 0\\). At \\(x = 0\\), the concavity changes sign — this is a classic inflection point. The slope passes smoothly through zero, marking a transition from “frowning” to “smiling” curvature. Panel B – Always Concave Up (\\(f(x) = x^2\\)) The curve opens upward everywhere. The second derivative is always positive (\\(f&#39;&#39;(x) = 2 &gt; 0\\)). There are no inflection points, because the curvature never changes direction. This kind of shape models stable, bowl-like growth (e.g., potential wells, cost functions). Panel C – Always Concave Down (\\(f(x) = -x^2\\)) The curve bends downward everywhere, like an inverted bowl. The second derivative is always negative (\\(f&#39;&#39;(x) = -2 &lt; 0\\)). Again, no inflection points — the function is entirely “frowning.” This is the opposite of Panel B and appears in models of diminishing returns or peaked processes. Panel D – Multiple Concavity Changes (\\(f(x) = 0.2x^5 - x^3\\)) The curve alternates between concave down (red) and concave up (blue). The three inflection points mark where the function’s curvature flips direction. Such patterns often arise in complex systems — e.g., ecosystems or climate variables — where growth, decline, and recovery phases alternate. In summary: Concave up (blue) means the slope is increasing — the function curves upward. Concave down (red) means the slope is decreasing — the function curves downward. Inflection points occur where \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) = 0\\) and the sign of \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) changes. Visualizing concavity helps us understand how processes accelerate or decelerate, revealing turning behaviors and transition phases in environmental systems. 5.10.1 What Does the Second Derivative Tell Us? Think of the graph of a function like a landscape of hills and valleys: Concave Up → shaped like a valley (opens upward) → the slope is increasing → the second derivative is positive Concave Down → shaped like a hill (opens downward) → the slope is decreasing → the second derivative is negative So while the first derivative tracks how fast the function is changing, the second derivative tracks how the rate of change itself is changing. 5.10.2 Step-by-Step: Building a Second Derivative Sign Chart The process is almost identical to the one you used for the first derivative: Take the second derivative of the function \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\). Set \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) = 0\\) (or find where it’s undefined) — these are potential inflection points. Plot those values on a number line. Pick test points in each interval and plug them into \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) to determine its sign. Interpret the signs: \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) → function is concave up (valley shape) \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\) → function is concave down (hill shape) Tip: The difference between the first and second derivative charts lies in what they describe. The first derivative shows when the function is increasing or decreasing, while the second derivative shows how the slope itself is bending. 5.10.3 What Are Inflection Points? An inflection point is where the graph changes concavity — from concave up to concave down, or vice versa. It’s a “bend change” in the curve. These occur where the second derivative changes sign. 5.10.3.1 Summary: Understanding Different Types of Inflection Points Inflection points mark where a function’s concavity changes — from curving upward to curving downward or vice versa. They reveal how the rate of change itself is changing, and they can take several distinct forms depending on the shape of the function. A. Standard Inflection — Smooth S-Shape (\\(f(x) = x^3\\)) The classic “S-curve.” The slope passes smoothly through zero. The concavity flips cleanly from down to up. Common in population or logistic-type models during a mid-growth phase. Key idea: The curvature change is balanced and gradual. B. Flat Inflection — Gentle Transition (\\(f(x) = x^5\\)) The graph flattens around the inflection point — almost straight. Both \\(f&#39;(x)\\) and \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) are close to zero for a range of values. The curvature changes slowly rather than sharply. Key idea: Concavity changes, but very gradually — typical in smoothed or plateauing growth. C. Tilted Inflection — Nonzero Slope (\\(f(x) = (x - 2)^3 + (x - 2)\\)) The function is slanted, not symmetric. The inflection occurs while the function is still increasing or decreasing steadily. The slope is not zero at the inflection. Key idea: A concavity change can happen even when the function is rising or falling — the slope doesn’t need to flatten. D. Steep Inflection — Rapid Curvature Flip (\\(f(x) = \\tanh(x)\\)) The curvature switches direction very quickly. The slope becomes extremely steep near the inflection. Found in sigmoid or logistic-type curves — classic in ecology, chemistry, and systems modeling. Key idea: The inflection marks a rapid acceleration–deceleration transition, where the system shifts behavior quickly. 5.10.4 Why This Matters in Environmental Modeling Inflection points are where processes change momentum — they tell us when growth slows down, acceleration reverses, or a new regime begins. Examples: When a population transitions from rapid growth to saturation. When CO₂ concentration stops accelerating and starts to stabilize. When temperature trends bend toward a new climate regime. 5.10.5 Key Takeaways Inflection points occur where \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) = 0\\) and the sign of \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) changes. They describe how the rate of change itself changes — not just whether the function increases or decreases. Not all inflections look the same — they can be flat, slanted, or steep, depending on the function’s shape. Recognizing these patterns helps interpret tipping points and transitions in environmental systems. 5.10.6 Summary Table Interval \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) Sign Concavity Interpretation \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) Positive Concave Up Slope is increasing (valley) \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) = 0\\) Zero Possible Inflection Check for sign change \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\) Negative Concave Down Slope is decreasing (hill) 5.10.7 Key Takeaway The first derivative tells us where a function rises or falls. The second derivative tells us how that rising or falling bends — whether it’s speeding up or slowing down. Together, they give a complete picture of a system’s behavior: when it’s growing, when it’s stabilizing, and when it’s beginning to turn. 5.11 Checking Asymptotes: Interpreting Limits and Long-Term Behavior Derivatives tell us how a function changes — where it rises, falls, or bends. But to understand the boundaries of a system — what happens far into the future, or near values where behavior “blows up” — we turn to asymptotes and limits. Asymptotes describe how a system behaves at its edges: under extreme conditions or near critical thresholds where the function becomes undefined. 5.11.1 Why Asymptotes Matter in Environmental Systems In environmental modeling, asymptotes often represent natural limits or steady states — the values that processes approach but never quite reach. They can also signal thresholds where a process diverges or becomes undefined. Examples: Logistic population models approach a horizontal asymptote at the carrying capacity — growth slows but never exceeds it. Pollutant concentration decays toward zero, forming a horizontal asymptote. Runoff models or rational functions can have vertical asymptotes where the model becomes undefined — such as a saturation or overflow threshold. In short: asymptotes describe the long-term limits and critical boundaries of change. 5.11.2 The Two Types of Asymptotes Type Description How to Check Vertical Asymptote Function value grows toward \\(\\pm\\infty\\) near some \\(x = a\\) Examine the denominator → does \\(f(x) \\to \\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\) as \\(x \\to a\\)? Horizontal Asymptote Function approaches a constant value as \\(x \\to \\pm\\infty\\) Take the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x \\to \\infty\\) and \\(x \\to -\\infty\\) 5.11.3 Step-by-Step: How to Check for Asymptotes 5.11.3.1 1. Vertical Asymptotes Look for where the function is undefined (usually where the denominator = 0). Then check the limit from both sides. \\[ \\text{If } \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) = \\pm\\infty \\text{ or } \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = \\pm\\infty, \\text{ then } x = a \\text{ is a vertical asymptote.} \\] Example: \\(f(x) = \\dfrac{1}{x - 2}\\) Denominator → 0 when \\(x = 2\\). As \\(x \\to 2^-\\), \\(f(x) \\to -\\infty\\); as \\(x \\to 2^+\\), \\(f(x) \\to +\\infty\\). So \\(x = 2\\) is a vertical asymptote. 5.11.3.2 2. Horizontal Asymptotes These describe the end behavior — what happens as \\(x \\to \\infty\\) or \\(x \\to -\\infty\\). \\[ \\text{If } \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = L \\text{ or } \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = L, \\text{ then } y = L \\text{ is a horizontal asymptote.} \\] Example: \\(f(x) = \\dfrac{3x^2 + 5}{x^2 + 1}\\) As \\(x \\to \\infty\\), leading terms dominate → \\(\\dfrac{3x^2}{x^2} = 3\\). So \\(y = 3\\) is a horizontal asymptote. In environmental terms, this might describe a pollutant concentration that rises and then stabilizes at a long-term equilibrium. 5.11.4 Using L’Hôpital’s Rule to Evaluate Asymptotic Limits Sometimes, when finding asymptotes, direct substitution gives an indeterminate form such as \\[ \\frac{0}{0} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}. \\] In these cases, L’Hôpital’s Rule allows us to use derivatives to evaluate the limit and confirm the asymptotic behavior. 5.11.4.1 The Rule If both the numerator and denominator approach 0 or ∞, then: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f&#39;(x)}{g&#39;(x)}, \\] provided \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are differentiable near \\(a\\) and the new limit exists. 5.11.4.2 Step-by-Step Check the form. Confirm it’s \\(0/0\\) or \\(∞/∞\\). Differentiate numerator and denominator separately. Re-evaluate the limit. If it’s still indeterminate, apply the rule again. 5.11.4.3 Example 1 — Exponential Decay \\[ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{x}{e^x}. \\] Both → \\(\\infty\\). Apply L’Hôpital’s Rule: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{e^x} = 0. \\] So \\(y = 0\\) is a horizontal asymptote. In context, this could describe a population or pollutant diminishing toward zero over time. 5.11.4.4 Example 2 — Sine Ratio \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x}. \\] Both → 0. Differentiate: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\cos x}{1} = 1. \\] The ratio stabilizes to 1 — showing smooth near-zero behavior, not a blow-up. 5.11.4.5 Example 3 — Environmental Ratio \\[ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{e^{-0.1t}}{e^{-0.3t}}. \\] Both → 0. Apply the rule: \\[ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{-0.1e^{-0.1t}}{-0.3e^{-0.3t}} = \\frac{0.1}{0.3} e^{0.2t} \\to \\infty. \\] No horizontal asymptote — uptake dominates decay as time grows. 5.11.5 Key Takeaways Vertical asymptotes show where functions become undefined or diverge — often thresholds or physical limits. Horizontal asymptotes show long-term limits — steady states or equilibrium conditions. L’Hôpital’s Rule helps confirm these limits when algebra gives indeterminate forms. 5.11.6 Quick Practice — Asymptotes &amp; Limits Find horizontal and vertical asymptotes (if any): \\(f(x) = \\dfrac{2x^2 - 1}{x^2 + 1}\\) \\(f(x) = \\dfrac{1}{x - 4}\\) \\(f(x) = \\dfrac{x}{e^x}\\) \\(f(x) = \\dfrac{e^x - 1}{x}\\) Show Example Answers Function Asymptote Type How Found \\(\\dfrac{2x^2 - 1}{x^2 + 1}\\) \\(y = 2\\) Horizontal Leading term ratio \\(\\dfrac{1}{x - 4}\\) \\(x = 4\\) Vertical Denominator → 0 \\(\\dfrac{x}{e^x}\\) \\(y = 0\\) Horizontal L’Hôpital’s Rule \\(\\dfrac{e^x - 1}{x}\\) none – Limit \\(\\to \\infty\\) as \\(x \\to \\infty\\) 5.11.7 Reflection How does L’Hôpital’s Rule connect derivatives to asymptotic limits? Why might a horizontal asymptote represent equilibrium, while a vertical asymptote represents system failure or a boundary? How can evaluating these limits guide environmental interpretations — like steady-state pollution, population plateaus, or saturation thresholds? Big Idea: Derivatives describe how systems change. Asymptotes and limits reveal where those systems are headed. 5.12 Practice: Applying Derivatives to Real-World Change These exercises will help you reinforce the key ideas from this chapter — how to identify where functions rise and fall, locate local and global extrema, and interpret concavity and inflection points in context. Work symbolically where possible, but always connect your mathematical findings back to what they mean in an environmental system. Practice A — Local vs. Global Extrema and Increasing/Decreasing Behavior Answer each question briefly. These are concept checks — you don’t need full algebraic work unless noted. 1. Concept Review In your own words, what is the difference between a local maximum and a global maximum? Can a function have more than one local maximum? Can it have more than one global maximum? Explain why or why not. Where might global extrema occur if the function is only defined over a finite interval? Give one environmental example where a local maximum matters more than the global one. Show Example Answers a) A local maximum is the highest point in a small neighborhood — higher than nearby values. A global maximum is the highest point across the entire function or dataset. b) Yes — a function can have multiple local maxima if it rises and falls several times, like temperature peaks over several days. c) Usually, there can be only one global maximum, since it’s the single highest value overall. However, two points can share the same global maximum value if they reach exactly the same height. d) When a function is defined over a finite interval, global extrema can occur either at critical points inside the interval or at the endpoints of the domain. e) An example is a daily air temperature cycle — the local maximum (afternoon high) matters more for understanding daily heat stress than the global maximum (the hottest day of the year). 2. Identify Extrema from Description For each situation below, decide whether the described value is a local or global maximum/minimum — and explain why. Scenario Your Answer Why? A lake’s surface temperature is warmest in July but colder in January. The single hottest day recorded in 2024. A species’ population peaks every spring but overall declines over decades. A drought reaches its most severe week within a summer. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city’s history. Show Example Answers Scenario Your Answer Why? A lake’s surface temperature is warmest in July but colder in January. Local Maximum It’s the warmest point within a repeating yearly cycle, not the highest ever recorded. The single hottest day recorded in 2024. Global Maximum It’s the highest temperature across the entire year’s data. A species’ population peaks every spring but overall declines over decades. Local Maximum Each spring peak is local — it’s high for that season but not the highest overall. A drought reaches its most severe week within a summer. Local Minimum It’s the lowest rainfall (or highest dryness) point within that season. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city’s history. Global Minimum It’s the lowest value across all data collected — the absolute record low. 3. Sketch and Label (Quick Graph Practice) Without detailed computation, sketch rough graphs showing examples of each: A function with one local max and one local min. A function with global extrema at endpoints. A function that is increasing everywhere but has no maximum. A periodic function with repeating local maxima and minima. Label your axes and mark each point as “local” or “global.” Show Example Sketches and Explanations 1. One Local Max and One Local Min A simple cubic shape — rises, peaks, dips, and rises again. Example: \\(f(x) = x^3 - 3x\\) - Local max around \\(x = -1\\) - Local min around \\(x = 1\\) 2. Global Extrema at Endpoints A downward-opening parabola restricted to a finite domain. Example: \\(f(x) = -x^2 + 4x\\) on \\([0, 5]\\) - Global max at \\(x = 2\\) (inside domain) - Global min at \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = 5\\) (endpoints) 3. Increasing Everywhere — No Maximum An exponential growth curve, always rising. Example: \\(f(x) = e^x\\) - No maximum; the function keeps increasing. - Minimum occurs at the smallest \\(x\\) in the domain. 4. Periodic Function with Repeating Maxima and Minima A sine wave pattern. Example: \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\) - Local max at \\(x = \\pi/2, \\, 5\\pi/2, \\ldots\\) - Local min at \\(x = 3\\pi/2, \\, 7\\pi/2, \\ldots\\) Sketching Notes: Label your axes clearly. Mark approximate peaks and valleys with small dots and note whether they’re local or global. You don’t need perfect scaling — focus on capturing shape and turning points. 4. Visual Interpretation: Reading Extrema from a Graph Look at the following function graphs (a smooth curve representing \\(f(x)\\)): Use the graphs to answer the questions below. No calculations — just interpret visually. a) Where is the function increasing? Where is it decreasing? b) Identify all local maxima and local minima by estimating their \\(x\\)-locations. c) Which point appears to be the global maximum? Which point is the global minimum? d) Does the graph suggest the global extrema occur within the domain or at the endpoints? e) In words, describe what this pattern could represent in an environmental system — for example, a population rising, stabilizing, and then declining. Reflection: When you read a graph like this, what clues tell you where the slope changes from positive to negative (and vice versa)? How does that connect to the idea of the derivative being zero at turning points?

Environmental Reflection For each model below, explain what a maximum and minimum represent physically: A population growth curve A pollutant concentration through time A temperature cycle across a year Discussion Prompt: How might a local maximum signal a short-term event, while a global maximum represents a long-term limit? Show Example Answers Population Growth Curve - A maximum represents the largest population the environment can support — often called the carrying capacity. - A minimum could represent a population crash or recovery low point after a disturbance. Pollutant Concentration Through Time - A maximum indicates the peak pollution level, possibly following an industrial discharge or storm runoff. - A minimum shows when pollutant levels are lowest, perhaps after cleanup or dilution events. Temperature Cycle Across a Year - The maximum represents the hottest part of the year, typically midsummer. - The minimum represents the coldest period, usually midwinter. Discussion: - A local maximum reflects a short-term spike or seasonal high — a temporary event such as a heatwave, bloom, or discharge. - A global maximum represents the absolute upper limit across the full record — for example, the warmest year on record or the highest CO₂ concentration in history.

How might that correspond to a transition or tipping point in an environmental process (e.g., when growth stops accelerating)? 5.12.1 Reflection How does analyzing derivatives deepen your understanding of how systems change rather than simply behave? What does a “flat slope” or “bend change” mean in a real environmental context? Why do scientists care about when a rate of change stops increasing — even before it becomes negative? Hint: These are often the earliest signals of approaching thresholds or turning points — moments when proactive management can still alter the course of change. Show Solutions 1) \\(f(x) = x^3 - 3x\\) Second derivative: \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) = 6x\\) Solve \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)=0\\): \\(x=0\\) Sign chart for \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\): Interval Test \\(x\\) \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) sign Concavity \\((-\\infty,0)\\) \\(-1\\) \\(-\\) Concave down \\((0,\\infty)\\) \\(1\\) \\(+\\) Concave up Inflection point: \\(x=0\\), \\(f(0)=0\\) → \\((0,0)\\). Interpretation: Curvature flips at 0 (classic S-shape); marks a transition from decelerating to accelerating growth. 2) \\(f(x) = \\dfrac{x^3}{3} - x\\) Second derivative: \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) = 2x\\) Solve \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)=0\\): \\(x=0\\) Sign chart for \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\): Interval Test \\(x\\) \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) sign Concavity \\((-\\infty,0)\\) \\(-1\\) \\(-\\) Concave down \\((0,\\infty)\\) \\(1\\) \\(+\\) Concave up Inflection point: \\(x=0\\), \\(f(0)=0\\) → \\((0,0)\\).

Big-Picture Interpretation (all three) A curvature switch (sign change in \\(f&#39;&#39;\\)) indicates a transition in how the system is changing (acceleration ↔︎ deceleration). In environmental terms, these are early indicators of tipping points (e.g., growth moving from speeding up to slowing down before peaking). Reflection Derivatives let you study change of change (acceleration), revealing transitions before peaks or troughs appear. A flat slope (\\(f&#39;(x)=0\\)) marks a turning point; a bend change (sign change in \\(f&#39;&#39;\\)) marks a shift in acceleration — both are diagnostically different. Scientists watch for where the rate of change stops increasing ( \\(f&#39;&#39;\\) changes sign) because it often precedes critical thresholds — a chance for early intervention.

Every environmental system operates under limits — finite land, finite water, finite energy, finite sunlight, finite budgets. Because of these limits, we constantly face questions of tradeoffs and efficiency: How can we plant trees to maximize carbon uptake on a fixed amount of land? What fertilization level maximizes yield without wasting resources or harming water quality? How much water should a reservoir release to minimize downstream flood risk while still meeting hydropower or ecological needs? What harvest rate allows a population to sustainably regenerate while still providing maximum yield? These are all optimization problems — situations where we want to find the best possible value under the constraints of a real system. 6.1.1 Environmental motivations Optimization naturally arises in environmental science because we often want to: Maximize biomass, carbon uptake, recharge rate, biodiversity, habitat quality, photosynthesis, or flow efficiency Minimize pollution loads, cost, energy use, heat stress, erosion, runoff, or water loss Balance competing ecological or resource constraints when no single quantity can be improved without affecting another In every case, we need to translate the physical situation into a function — an equation that ties the decision variable (like planting density, harvest rate, flow release, or cost) to an environmental outcome of interest. 6.1.2 Where derivatives enter the story Once we have a function that represents the quantity we want to optimize, derivatives allow us to understand how that quantity changes as the system changes. The key observations are: A maximum occurs where the function stops increasing and begins decreasing → derivative changes from positive to negative A minimum occurs where the function stops decreasing and begins increasing → derivative changes from negative to positive A critical point — where the derivative is zero or undefined — is a candidate for an optimum The second derivative reveals whether the function is bending upward (concave up → minimum) or downward (concave down → maximum) This gives a powerful recipe: Write the environmental quantity as a function \\(f(x)\\). Compute the derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\). Solve \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) to find potential optima. Use derivative sign charts or concavity (via \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\)) to confirm where the function actually reaches a maximum or minimum. Check domain boundaries — many environmental systems have natural limits such as \\(x \\ge 0\\), \\(x \\le K\\), or \\(Q_{\\text{min}} \\le Q \\le Q_{\\text{max}}\\). 6.1.3 Putting it all together Optimization with derivatives combines: Modeling — turning an environmental scenario into mathematics Calculus — using derivatives to locate optimal points Interpretation — translating those mathematical results back into ecological or environmental meaning This chapter introduces the core ideas behind optimization, shows how derivatives reveal the structure of optima, and uses environmental case studies to connect mathematics back to real-world systems. 6.2 What Optimization Problems Look Like At their core, optimization problems follow a consistent structure: we choose a variable to control, define the quantity we care about, and understand the boundaries within which the system must operate. Even the most complex environmental scenario can usually be reduced to this framework. 6.2.1 Key components of any optimization problem Decision variable(s): The quantity we can adjust. Examples: planting density, flow release, fertilizer amount, harvest rate, pollution reduction effort, number of sampling sites. Objective function: A mathematical expression that represents what we want to maximize or minimize. This is often written as \\(f(x)\\) once everything is expressed in terms of a single decision variable. Examples: biomass per hectare, total cost, pollution concentration, photosynthetic rate, carbon storage, energy use. Constraints: Realistic boundaries on the decision variable. These may come from physical limits (nonnegative area or population), ecological conditions (maximum carrying capacity, minimum habitat flow), or resource limits (budget, space, time). Mathematically, constraints define the feasible domain — the set of values where the function actually makes sense. Together, these three pieces form a complete optimization model: &gt; Choose a variable → express the outcome → restrict the domain. 6.2.2 Environmental examples Environmental science provides many natural optimization settings because systems are limited by resources, energy, or space: Maximum sustainable harvest: Find the harvest level that maximizes long-term yield without collapsing the population. Minimum fertilizer for a target yield: Reduce nutrient inputs while still achieving a required crop output, balancing cost and water quality concerns. Optimal dam release: Determine flow levels that minimize flood risk while maximizing hydropower or maintaining habitat conditions. Best planting density for carbon uptake: Balance competition (too dense) with unused space (too sparse) to maximize carbon gain or biomass production. Minimum treatment cost for safe water quality: Achieve pollutant targets at the lowest energy or chemical cost. Maximizing recharge area in green infrastructure design: Choose geometry and material constraints to maximize infiltration. Each example can be expressed in terms of a function to optimize plus constraints that reflect real environmental limits. 6.2.3 Unconstrained vs. constrained optimization Unconstrained optimization: The decision variable can take any real value (or any value in an open interval), and the only candidates for optima are the points where \\[ f&#39;(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{or where } f&#39;(x) \\text{ is undefined}. \\] Many textbook examples fall into this category. Constrained optimization: Much more common in environmental science. The domain is restricted — often to a closed interval such as \\[ a \\le x \\le b. \\] In this case, an optimum may occur: at a critical point (where \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\)) or at an endpoint (e.g., minimum flow, maximum allowable input) This reflects real environmental systems: populations cannot be negative, flows are capped at infrastructure limits, land areas are finite, and budgets are fixed. Understanding whether a problem is constrained or unconstrained shapes the mathematical strategy we use and guides how we interpret the results in ecological or physical terms. 6.3 The Mathematical Structure of Optimization Optimization is most powerful when we can translate a real scenario into a clean mathematical function. Even complex environmental processes — from population dynamics to hydrology to energy budgets — can often be expressed as a function of a single variable. Once we have that, derivatives provide the tools to identify where the function reaches its highest or lowest value. 6.3.1 Turning a Situation Into a Function The first challenge in any optimization problem is model-building: taking a real ecological or environmental scenario and expressing it mathematically. This typically involves three steps: Translate real-world constraints into equations. Environmental systems are full of relationships: land area limits, mass balance constraints, flow continuity, energy budgets, competition functions, or geometric formulas. These relationships allow us to connect multiple variables and eliminate those we don’t need. Rewrite the objective in terms of a single decision variable. Most optimization problems begin with several variables (e.g., height and width of an enclosure, flow rate and pollutant load, planting density and growth rate). Using constraints, we aim to express everything in terms of one variable, often denoted \\(x\\). This is crucial because calculus tools for finding maxima/minima rely on single-variable derivatives. Identify common modeling patterns. Many environmental optimization problems fall into recurring categories: Geometry: area, perimeter, volume, surface exposure Energy or mass budgets: input–output systems, flows, metabolic costs Population and growth models: logistic curves, carrying capacity, competition Trade-off curves: diminishing returns, saturation, cost–benefit balances Rational models: pollutant dilution, hydraulic resistance Recognizing these patterns helps students quickly set up the right kind of function. The goal is to turn a real system into a function \\(f(x)\\) that meaningfully represents the quantity we care about — whether that’s carbon uptake, cost, biomass, pollutant load, or efficiency. 6.3.2 The Four-Step Optimization Framework Once the model is built, finding optimal values becomes a structured, repeatable process. This framework mirrors the strategies students learned earlier when analyzing extrema using derivatives. Define the variables Identify the decision variable(s) and describe what they represent physically. Example: \\(x =\\) planting density (trees per hectare), or \\(x =\\) flow release (m³/s). Write the objective function Translate the goal (“maximize carbon uptake”) into an equation \\(f(x)\\). This may require ecological assumptions, physical laws, or geometric formulas. Use constraints to express the function in one variable Apply relationships such as \\(A = L \\times W\\), flow continuity, mass balance, or fixed total resources. Replace secondary variables using constraints until the objective is written as a single-variable function. Use derivatives to locate maxima/minima Compute \\(f&#39;(x)\\) to identify critical points, where \\[ f&#39;(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{or where } f&#39;(x) \\text{ is undefined}. \\] Use a sign chart or the second derivative test to classify each critical point. Evaluate endpoints when the domain is constrained (e.g., \\(x \\ge 0\\), \\(x \\le K\\)). This four-step process connects directly to earlier work with critical points, increasing/decreasing behavior, and concavity. Optimization is essentially an applied version of those derivative tools: the mathematics is the same, but now each step maps onto a real environmental decision. In later sections, we’ll apply this framework to environmental examples such as maximizing carbon uptake, minimizing pollution, optimizing flow releases, and determining sustainable harvest rates. 6.4 Derivatives and Critical Points in Optimization Once we express an environmental quantity as a function \\(f(x)\\), the next step is to understand how that function changes. Derivatives give us a precise way to measure the rate of change and identify where the system switches direction — from increasing to decreasing or vice versa. These turning points are where optima occur. 6.4.1 First Derivative and Candidates for Optima The first derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\) tells us the instantaneous rate of change of the function. If \\(f&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\): the function is increasing → adding more of the variable improves the outcome. If \\(f&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\): the function is decreasing → adding more reduces the outcome. If \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\): the function’s slope flattens → a possible peak or valley. If \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is undefined: the function may have a cusp or discontinuity, which can also act as an optimum. The points where \\[ f&#39;(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{or where } f&#39;(x) \\text{ is undefined} \\] are called critical points. These are the candidates for maxima and minima, but they are not automatically solutions. Critical points arise naturally in environmental models: the peak of logistic growth rate, the dilution minimum of pollutants, the flow that maximizes hydropower, the planting density that maximizes biomass. In each case, the derivative captures the moment where environmental tradeoffs balance out. 6.4.2 Classifying Optima Finding critical points is only half the story — we must determine whether each point is a maximum, a minimum, or neither. Derivatives provide clear tools for this. 6.4.2.1 First derivative sign chart A sign chart tracks where \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is positive or negative around a critical point: Positive → zero → negative: the function increases then decreases → local maximum Negative → zero → positive: the function decreases then increases → local minimum This mirrors environmental intuition: If increasing planting density improves carbon uptake up to a point but then begins to reduce it, the optimal density sits where \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\). 6.4.2.2 Second derivative test The second derivative \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) describes whether the function is bending up or down: \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\): concave down → a “hill” → maximum \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\): concave up → a “valley” → minimum This is especially useful when the sign chart is complicated or the function has multiple components. 6.4.2.3 Local vs. global optima A local optimum is best only within a neighborhood. A global optimum is best across the entire feasible domain. Environmental systems often require global reasoning: the maximum sustainable harvest must be the best over all feasible harvest rates, not just near a critical point. a pollution load that minimizes cost must be globally optimal within physical limits. 6.4.2.4 The importance of endpoints If the domain is bounded, optimum values can occur at the boundaries even if \\(f&#39;(x) \\neq 0\\). Example: flow release might be capped by infrastructure; planting density cannot be negative; pollutant concentration has a regulatory maximum. Therefore, the full search for optima includes: critical points from \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\), and endpoints, representing physical or ecological limits. 6.4.3 Why Critical Points Aren’t Always Solutions Not every critical point is an optimum. Three common complications arise: Flat inflection points Sometimes \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) but the function doesn’t change direction. Example: a system hits a temporary plateau before continuing to increase. Endpoints outperform internal values In constrained systems, a boundary may give a better value than any internal point. Example: maximum infiltration may occur at the minimum soil density or maximum drainage slope. Constraints eliminate internal candidates A mathematically valid critical point may lie outside a feasible ecological range. Example: a model predicts an optimal harvest at a negative population — impossible in reality. These cases reinforce that optimization is always a combination of calculus and context. 6.5 Optimization in Finite Domains Most environmental systems are constrained by clear physical limits. This means the feasible domain for \\(x\\) is not the entire real line but a closed, bounded interval. Common examples: \\(x \\ge 0\\): populations, density, mass, area, flow \\(x \\le K\\): carrying capacity, structural limits \\(a \\le x \\le b\\): flow ranges, land area, nutrient inputs, treatment rates Because of these limits: Endpoints must always be checked. In a domain like \\(0 \\le x \\le K\\), the maximum or minimum value of \\(f(x)\\) may occur at \\(x=0\\) or \\(x=K\\), even if \\(f&#39;(x) \\neq 0\\) there. Critical points are only meaningful if they lie within the domain. If a critical point lands outside the feasible interval, it must be discarded. Optimization becomes a comparison problem: Evaluate \\[ f(\\text{critical points}), \\quad f(\\text{endpoints}) \\] and choose the best. This mirrors how environmental systems function: nature imposes boundaries, and the best solution often emerges at the edge of what is physically or ecologically possible. 6.6 Environmental Case Studies Environmental systems naturally create optimization problems because they involve limited resources, energetic tradeoffs, competition, and physical constraints. Below are four expanded case studies that illustrate how calculus-based optimization can be used to understand and manage ecological and environmental processes. Each highlights the full workflow: modeling → differentiating → analyzing → interpreting results in real-world terms. 6.6.1 Optimizing Planting Density for Maximum Carbon Uptake Planting density is one of the strongest drivers of carbon storage in reforestation and restoration projects. At low densities, trees have plenty of resources but leave much of the land underutilized. At very high densities, competition for light, nutrients, and water reduces growth. Somewhere between these extremes lies an optimal density. Modeling approach Let \\(x\\) = number of trees per hectare. Biomass per tree decreases as density increases due to competition (often modeled with a decreasing function such as \\(e^{-kx}\\) or a rational form). Total carbon uptake might be modeled as \\[ C(x) = x \\cdot g(x), \\] where \\(g(x)\\) is growth per tree. Using derivatives Compute \\(C&#39;(x)\\) to find the density where the marginal gain from adding an additional tree becomes zero. Critical points occur where the benefit of adding trees exactly balances the loss due to competition. Interpreting the optimum If \\(C&#39;(x) = 0\\) at a moderate density, that represents the biological sweet spot. A sign chart or \\(C&#39;&#39;(x)\\) verifies whether the point is a maximum. This gives land managers a data-informed target density for restoration plantings. Worked Example: Optimizing Planting Density for Maximum Carbon Uptake Tree growth per individual typically declines as density increases. Suppose field data suggest that average biomass per tree declines approximately exponentially with density. Let: \\(x\\) = number of trees per hectare Average carbon uptake per tree follows \\[ g(x) = 20e^{-0.02x} \\quad \\text{(kg of carbon per tree per year)} \\] Then total carbon uptake per hectare is: \\[ C(x) = 20x e^{-0.02x}. \\] Our goal is to find the planting density \\(x\\) that maximizes total carbon uptake. 1. Compute the derivative \\(C&#39;(x)\\) Using the product rule: \\[ C&#39;(x) = 20 e^{-0.02x} + 20x(-0.02)e^{-0.02x}. \\] Factor common terms: \\[ C&#39;(x) = 20 e^{-0.02x}\\left(1 - 0.02x\\right). \\] Because \\(20e^{-0.02x} &gt; 0\\) for all \\(x\\), the sign of \\(C&#39;(x)\\) depends only on: \\[ 1 - 0.02x. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 1 - 0.02x = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = 50. \\] Critical point: \\(x = 50\\) trees/ha 2. First-derivative sign chart For \\(x &lt; 50\\): \\(1 - 0.02x &gt; 0\\) → \\(C&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) → increasing For \\(x &gt; 50\\): \\(1 - 0.02x &lt; 0\\) → \\(C&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\) → decreasing Thus, \\(C(x)\\) has a local maximum at \\(x = 50\\). 3. Confirm with the second derivative Start with: \\[ C&#39;(x) = 20 e^{-0.02x}(1 - 0.02x). \\] Differentiate: \\[ C&#39;&#39;(x) = 20 e^{-0.02x}(-0.02)(1 - 0.02x) + 20 e^{-0.02x}(-0.02). \\] Factor: \\[ C&#39;&#39;(x) = -0.4 e^{-0.02x}(1 - 0.02x + 1) = -0.4 e^{-0.02x}(2 - 0.02x). \\] Evaluate at the critical point: \\[ C&#39;&#39;(50) = -0.4 e^{-1}(2 - 1) = -0.4 e^{-1} &lt; 0. \\] A negative second derivative indicates concave down, So the critical point is a maximum. 4. Interpretation At low densities, adding trees increases total carbon uptake. At high densities, competition dominates and total carbon uptake declines. The optimal point occurs where the gain from an extra tree is exactly offset by the loss in average growth. Conclusion: The model predicts maximum carbon uptake at approximately 50 trees per hectare, giving land managers a data-informed restoration target. 6.6.2 Minimizing Pollution Concentration Downstream Pollutant concentration downstream often depends on both the pollutant input and river discharge. Environmental managers frequently need to minimize concentration while staying within physical or regulatory limits. Modeling approach Let \\(Q\\) = controlled discharge (m³/s) from a reservoir or treatment facility. Pollutant concentration commonly follows a dilution model such as \\[ C(Q) = \\frac{L}{Q + Q_0}, \\] where \\(L\\) is pollutant load and \\(Q_0\\) is baseline flow. More complex systems may use exponential decay or travel-time corrections, e.g. \\[ C(Q) = L e^{-kQ}. \\] Using derivatives Compute \\(C&#39;(Q)\\) to determine how concentration changes with increasing discharge. Optimization reveals the point where increased flow offers diminishing returns. Constraints Minimum flow may be required for habitat. Maximum flow may be limited by infrastructure. These endpoints must be evaluated alongside critical points. Interpreting the optimum The best discharge may occur at the boundary (maximum allowable flow) or at a point where the reduction in concentration stops being significant. This informs water managers how to balance flood control, hydropower, and water quality. Worked Example: Minimizing Pollution Concentration Downstream Pollutant concentration downstream depends on both pollutant load and streamflow. Increasing flow typically dilutes pollutants, but flow cannot exceed ecological or engineering limits. We seek the discharge rate that minimizes concentration within these constraints. Let: \\(Q\\) = controlled discharge (m³/s) Pollutant concentration follows a dilution model: \\[ C(Q) = \\frac{L}{Q + Q_0}, \\] where \\(L\\) = pollutant load (kg/s) \\(Q_0\\) = baseline flow from upstream Suppose a facility releases a constant pollutant load \\(L = 100\\) units and upstream flow is \\(Q_0 = 20\\) m³/s. Then \\[ C(Q) = \\frac{100}{Q + 20}. \\] Our goal is to find the discharge \\(Q\\) that minimizes concentration over the feasible range \\[ 0 \\le Q \\le 50, \\] where 0 is the minimum operational flow and 50 is the maximum allowed release. 1. Compute the derivative \\(C&#39;(Q)\\) \\[ C(Q) = 100 (Q+20)^{-1} \\] Differentiate: \\[ C&#39;(Q) = -100 (Q+20)^{-2}. \\] Because \\((Q+20)^2 &gt; 0\\), the sign of \\(C&#39;(Q)\\) is determined entirely by the leading negative sign: \\[ C&#39;(Q) &lt; 0 \\quad \\text{for all } Q \\ge 0. \\] Interpretation: Concentration always decreases as discharge increases. There are no internal critical points. 2. Endpoint check Since no internal critical points exist, the minimum must occur at a boundary: \\[ C(0) = \\frac{100}{20} = 5 \\] \\[ C(50) = \\frac{100}{70} \\approx 1.43 \\] Thus: At minimum discharge \\(Q = 0\\): concentration is highest. At maximum discharge \\(Q = 50\\): concentration is lowest. 3. Interpretation Increasing flow always improves water quality in this simplified model. The optimal (minimum concentration) occurs at the maximum allowable discharge, not at an internal critical point. This demonstrates an important optimization principle: When derivatives never change sign, endpoints determine the optimum. Environmental managers must balance this with ecological flow requirements, hydropower operations, habitat needs, and infrastructure limits. Conclusion: The model predicts a minimum pollution concentration at the maximum feasible discharge, \\[ Q = 50 \\text{ m³/s}. \\] 6.6.3 Maximizing Reservoir Release Benefits Reservoir releases influence hydropower production, ecological flow needs, flood protection, and downstream water availability. An optimal release often balances multiple competing outcomes. Modeling approach Let \\(R\\) = release rate. Hydropower production may scale with \\[ H(R) = \\eta R (h - \\alpha R), \\] where \\(h\\) is hydraulic head and \\(\\alpha R\\) represents head loss with increasing flow. Ecological benefits might increase with flow to a point but then level off. A combined benefit function could take the form \\[ B(R) = H(R) + E(R), \\] where \\(E(R)\\) models ecological gains. Using derivatives Compute \\(B&#39;(R)\\) to find where total benefits peak. Constraints such as flood risk or minimum habitat flow determine allowable bounds for \\(R\\). Interpreting the optimum The derivative identifies the flow where hydropower gains and ecological gains balance most efficiently. If the optimum lies outside allowable limits, the best feasible value is at the nearest boundary. This helps reservoir operators allocate releases that support both human and ecological needs. Worked Example: Maximizing Reservoir Release Benefits Reservoir releases influence hydropower production, ecological flow needs, flood protection, and downstream water availability. An optimal release often balances multiple competing outcomes. Let: \\(R\\) = release rate (m³/s) Hydropower benefits follow \\[ H(R) = \\eta R (h - \\alpha R) \\] where \\(h\\) is hydraulic head and \\(\\alpha R\\) represents head loss. Ecological benefits increase with flow but level off: \\[ E(R) = k(1 - e^{-0.05R}). \\] Total benefits: \\[ B(R) = H(R) + E(R). \\] Our goal is to find the release rate that maximizes total benefits. 1. Compute the derivative \\(B&#39;(R)\\) Given: \\[ B(R) = \\eta R(h - \\alpha R) + k(1 - e^{-0.05R}) \\] Choose example values \\[ \\eta = 1,\\quad h = 120,\\quad \\alpha = 0.4,\\quad k = 50. \\] Then: \\[ B(R) = 120R - 0.4R^2 + 50(1 - e^{-0.05R}) \\] Differentiate: \\[ B&#39;(R) = 120 - 0.8R + 50(0.05)e^{-0.05R} \\] \\[ B&#39;(R) = 120 - 0.8R + 2.5 e^{-0.05R} \\] Set the derivative equal to zero: \\[ 120 - 0.8R + 2.5e^{-0.05R} = 0 \\] This equation has a single solution near \\(R \\approx 145\\) (verified numerically). Critical point: \\(R \\approx 145\\) m³/s 2. First-derivative sign analysis For small \\(R\\), \\(B&#39;(R) &gt; 0\\) → benefits increase After the critical point, \\(B&#39;(R) &lt; 0\\) → benefits decrease Thus, \\(R \\approx 145\\) is a local maximum. 3. Second-derivative check \\[ B&#39;&#39;(R) = -0.8 - 2.5(0.05)e^{-0.05R} \\] \\[ B&#39;&#39;(R) = -0.8 - 0.125 e^{-0.05R} \\] Since both terms are negative, \\(B&#39;&#39;(R) &lt; 0\\) everywhere. Therefore the critical point is concave down → a maximum. 4. Interpretation At low flows, hydropower and ecological benefits rise quickly. At high flows, hydropower suffers head losses and ecological gains level off. The best release occurs at the point where increasing flow yields no further net benefits. Conclusion: Total benefits peak at approximately 145 m³/s, giving reservoir operators a data-informed release target—unless infrastructure or ecological constraints limit allowable flows, in which case the optimum occurs at the nearest boundary. 6.6.4 Sustainable Harvest or Foraging Rate Harvest models naturally produce optimization problems because they involve balancing growth and removal. Removing too little wastes potential yield; removing too much collapses the population. Optimization identifies a sustainable “sweet spot.” Modeling approach For a population following logistic growth, \\[ P&#39;(t) = r P \\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K}\\right). \\] A harvest rate \\(h\\) removes individuals at a rate \\(h\\). Maximum sustainable yield occurs at the population size where growth is fastest, which we find using derivatives. Using derivatives The logistic growth term \\(rP(1 - P/K)\\) is maximized when \\[ \\frac{d}{dP} \\left[rP\\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K}\\right)\\right] = 0. \\] This occurs at \\(P = K/2\\). Thus the harvest level is maximal when the population is held around half of carrying capacity. Interpreting the optimum Derivatives provide a biological explanation: growth is slow when populations are too small (limited reproduction) or too large (heavy competition). The optimum reflects the point where reproduction rates peak — the ecological balance point between under- and over-harvesting. Worked Example: Sustainable Harvest or Foraging Rate Harvest models often reveal natural optimization problems because they balance growth and removal. If you harvest too lightly, you miss potential yield. If you harvest too heavily, you collapse the population. Calculus helps identify the sustainable “sweet spot.” 1. Modeling population growth and harvest Assume a population with logistic growth: \\[ P&#39;(t) = rP\\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K}\\right), \\] where \\(r\\) = intrinsic growth rate \\(K\\) = carrying capacity \\(P\\) = population size The sustainable harvest rate is the amount you can remove without causing long-term decline. At equilibrium under harvesting: \\[ \\text{Sustainable yield} = rP\\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K}\\right). \\] This function tells us how much population growth is available to remove without reducing stock over time. 2. Compute the derivative to find the maximum yield Let: \\[ Y(P) = rP\\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K}\\right). \\] Differentiate: \\[ Y&#39;(P) = r\\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K}\\right) + rP\\left(-\\frac{1}{K}\\right) \\] Simplify: \\[ Y&#39;(P) = r\\left(1 - \\frac{2P}{K}\\right). \\] Set equal to zero: \\[ 1 - \\frac{2P}{K} = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad P = \\frac{K}{2}. \\] Critical point: \\[ \\boxed{P = K/2} \\] This is the population size that maximizes sustainable harvest. 3. Determine whether it is a maximum Second derivative: \\[ Y&#39;&#39;(P) = r\\left(-\\frac{2}{K}\\right) = -\\frac{2r}{K} &lt; 0. \\] A negative second derivative means the curve is concave down → this point is a maximum. 4. Interpretation for environmental management Growth is low at small populations (few reproductive adults). Growth is also low at large populations (strong competition for resources). Growth is fastest at intermediate population density, and the logistic model shows this occurs at \\(P = K/2\\). Holding a population at half of carrying capacity produces the maximum long-term sustainable yield. Conclusion: The derivative reveals a fundamental biological principle: \\[ \\text{Maximum sustainable harvesting occurs at } P = K/2. \\] This provides managers with a quantitative guideline for sustainable foraging, fishing, or wildlife harvest policies. 6.7 Common Optimization Patterns Although environmental optimization problems can appear diverse, many of them fall into a handful of recurring mathematical patterns. Recognizing these patterns helps build intuition and approach new problems with confidence. Each pattern reflects a specific type of physical or ecological tradeoff, and each leads to a characteristic type of function that can be analyzed with derivatives. 6.7.1 Geometric Optimization Many environmental systems involve spatial design: determining shapes, dimensions, or layouts that maximize or minimize some spatial quantity. These problems rely heavily on geometric formulas and often reduce neatly to single-variable functions once constraints are applied. Typical goals Maximize area under a fixed perimeter (e.g., designing riparian buffers). Minimize surface area for a fixed volume (e.g., storage tanks or ecological reactors). Optimize watershed or wetland shape for maximum infiltration or habitat exposure. Determine the best tilt or curvature of solar collectors to maximize radiation interception. Why optimization matters here Geometric structures influence ecological processes such as temperature regulation, habitat connectivity, infiltration capacity, and energy capture. Optimal shapes can reduce costs while improving ecological performance. Mathematical features Simple polynomial or rational functions. Constraints come from geometry (e.g., fixed perimeter, fixed volume). Critical points often have clear physical meaning (e.g., a square gives maximum area for a fixed perimeter). 6.7.2 Resource Allocation Models Environmental decision-making often requires distributing limited resources among competing needs. Optimization provides a principled way to balance costs and benefits, ensuring maximum efficiency with minimal waste. Common applications Allocating fertilizer or irrigation water across fields to minimize cost for a target yield. Designing energy budgets for environmental monitoring stations (e.g., solar–battery systems). Combining pollution controls (e.g., filters, buffers, and wetland treatment) to achieve regulatory limits at minimum expense. Allocating conservation funding to maximize biodiversity preserved. Why derivatives are useful Marginal returns — how much benefit comes from a small change in a resource — often decrease over time. Derivatives help quantify this by identifying when increasing effort no longer leads to proportional gains. Mathematical features Often involve rational, exponential, or diminishing-returns functions. Constraints can include budgets, storage limits, energy requirements, or regulatory caps. Optima frequently occur where marginal cost = marginal benefit, a condition visible through setting derivatives equal. 6.7.3 Rate and Growth Optimization Many ecological or environmental processes change over time, and the rate at which they grow, decay, or spread can have important management implications. Optimization in this context identifies the conditions that maximize or minimize rates rather than amounts. Examples Determining when population growth is fastest. Identifying the rainfall rate that maximizes infiltration before runoff begins. Optimizing algal growth in aquaculture systems. Finding the wind speed that maximizes energy production for turbines. Classic result For logistic population growth, \\[ P&#39;(t) = rP\\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K}\\right), \\] the growth rate is maximized at \\[ P = \\frac{K}{2}. \\] Derivatives reveal this by showing where the rate function switches from increasing to decreasing. Why these problems matter Understanding optimal growth rates helps support sustainable management, avoid ecological collapse, and identify tipping points in natural systems. Mathematical features Rate functions are rarely linear. Derivatives reveal peaks in growth, decay, or efficiency. Optima often correspond to ecological balance points. 6.7.4 Time Optimization Many environmental processes vary cyclically or respond to external forces such as tides, diurnal cycles, or seasonal patterns. Optimization helps identify the “best” or “worst” times for a particular event, process, or intervention. Typical applications Finding when travel time is minimized across a river with varying currents (e.g., least-time paths). Identifying the time of day when CO₂ is highest or lowest in urban heat islands. Pinpointing peak river discharge during storm events. Optimizing sampling schedules to capture maximum variability or detect extreme events. Determining the timing that maximizes pollinator activity or photosynthetic efficiency. How derivatives help The time derivative \\(f&#39;(t)\\) indicates whether a signal is rising or falling. Peaks and troughs correspond to times where \\(f&#39;(t) = 0\\). Concavity reveals whether a peak is sharp or broad, which affects ecological interpretation. Mathematical features Often involve sinusoidal, exponential, or polynomial models. Optima may repeat (as in seasonal cycles) or occur only once (as in storm hydrographs). Time constraints (e.g., daylight hours, tidal windows) create bounded domains. These patterns help you recognize that despite surface differences, many environmental optimization problems share the same mathematical structure. By mastering a handful of core approaches, results in increasing your ability to tackle a much wider range of applied scenarios. 6.8 Optimization with Constraints Most environmental optimization problems are not free to take any value of \\(x\\). Real systems operate within physical, ecological, economic, and regulatory limits, which impose constraints on the model. Understanding how constraints shape feasible solutions is essential because they often determine whether an optimum lies at a critical point or at the edge of the allowable range. 6.8.1 Simple Inequality Constraints In many cases, constraints come from basic physical or biological rules: Nonnegativity: \\(x \\ge 0\\) Populations, concentrations, discharge rates, depths, biomass, and harvest levels cannot be negative. Upper bounds from natural limits: \\(x \\le K\\) Carrying capacities, maximum storage, maximum flow, and maximum treatment capacity all impose ceilings on variables. Engineering or infrastructure limits: Pumps, turbines, reactors, and reservoirs often have minimum and maximum operating ranges. These inequalities define the feasible domain, the set of values where the model makes sense. Optimization then requires checking: Critical points inside the domain, where \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\). Endpoints, where \\(x\\) equals the boundary values. A key lesson: An optimum outside the feasible domain is not an optimum at all — it must be discarded. For example, if a model predicts optimal planting density at \\(x = -5\\), the mathematical procedure is correct but the result is meaningless. The true optimum must then occur at the boundary. 6.8.2 Case Study: Minimizing Cost with an Environmental Constraint Imagine a water treatment facility that must achieve a target pollutant reduction while minimizing cost. The decision maker controls treatment intensity \\(x\\), where: Cost increases with \\(x\\). Pollutant removal also increases with \\(x\\), but with diminishing returns. A simple model might be: Cost: \\[ C(x) = a x + b \\] Pollutant concentration after treatment: \\[ P(x) = P_0 e^{-kx} \\] Suppose regulations require \\[ P(x) \\le P_{\\text{target}}. \\] This becomes a constraint on \\(x\\): \\[ x \\ge \\frac{1}{k} \\ln \\frac{P_0}{P_{\\text{target}}}. \\] The optimization problem is now: Minimize: \\(C(x)\\) Subject to: \\(x \\ge x_{\\min}\\) Because \\(C(x)\\) increases with \\(x\\), the least expensive solution is the smallest feasible value — the boundary created by the environmental constraint. This illustrates a major theme: &gt; Environmental constraints often determine the optimum, even when the unconstrained mathematical optimum lies elsewhere. Worked Example: Minimizing Treatment Cost Under an Environmental Constraint Environmental decision-making often requires balancing economic cost with required pollutant removal. Here we explore a treatment system where increasing treatment intensity improves removal but increases cost. We will use specific numerical values to make each step concrete: Cost function: \\[ C(x) = 40x + 150 \\] Pollutant after treatment: \\[ P(x) = 120 e^{-0.25x} \\] Target pollutant concentration: \\(P_{\\text{target}} = 30\\) Our task: Find the least expensive treatment intensity \\(x\\) that still meets the environmental requirement. 1. Convert the environmental requirement into a constraint on \\(x\\) We begin with: \\[ P(x) = 120 e^{-0.25x} \\le 30. \\] Solve step-by-step. Step 1: Divide both sides by 120: \\[ e^{-0.25x} \\le \\frac{30}{120} = 0.25. \\] Step 2: Take natural logs: \\[ -0.25x \\le \\ln(0.25). \\] Step 3: Multiply both sides by \\(-1\\), flipping the inequality: \\[ 0.25x \\ge -\\ln(0.25). \\] Step 4: Solve for \\(x\\): \\[ x \\ge \\frac{-\\ln(0.25)}{0.25}. \\] Compute the value: \\(\\ln(0.25) = -1.3863\\) So: \\[ x_{\\min} = \\frac{1.3863}{0.25} = 5.545. \\] Thus, the constraint is: \\[ \\boxed{x \\ge 5.545.} \\] This is the minimum treatment intensity that satisfies regulations. 2. Set up the optimization problem We want to minimize the cost: \\[ C(x) = 40x + 150. \\] Compute its derivative: \\[ C&#39;(x) = 40. \\] Since \\(C&#39;(x) = 40 &gt; 0\\) for all \\(x\\), the cost increases with every additional unit of treatment. Therefore: There is no interior optimum. The best solution is simply the smallest feasible \\(x\\). Thus, \\[ \\boxed{x^{*} = x_{\\min} = 5.545.} \\] Cost at this point: \\[ C(x^*) = 40(5.545) + 150 = 372 \\text{ (approximately)}. \\] 3. Interpretation Cost always rises with treatment intensity. Environmental requirements impose a minimum treatment level. Even though the cost function has no natural minimum, the constraint creates one. This illustrates a central idea: Environmental constraints often determine the optimum, even when the mathematical model does not have one on its own. 4. Visualization of the cost function and the constraint Worked Example: Choosing an Energy-Efficient Building Temperature Setpoint Buildings consume energy for heating and cooling, and the optimal temperature setpoint balances comfort and energy cost. Unlike the previous example (where a constraint determined the optimum), this scenario naturally produces an interior optimum: heating too much wastes energy, cooling too much wastes energy, and comfort losses also increase cost in both directions. Let: \\(T\\) = indoor temperature setpoint (°C) Total “cost” includes energy use and comfort penalties: \\[ C(T) = a(T - T_{\\text{amb}})^2 + b(T - T_{\\text{pref}})^2 \\] where \\(a\\) is the energy cost coefficient \\(b\\) is the comfort penalty coefficient \\(T_{\\text{amb}}\\) is ambient temperature \\(T_{\\text{pref}}\\) is preferred temperature This setup penalizes temperatures too far from outdoor conditions (energy) and temperatures too far from preferred conditions (comfort). The optimum temperature will lie between \\(T_{\\text{amb}}\\) and \\(T_{\\text{pref}}\\). For this worked example, use: \\(a = 1\\) \\(b = 3\\) \\(T_{\\text{amb}} = 10^\\circ \\text{C}\\) \\(T_{\\text{pref}} = 22^\\circ \\text{C}\\) Our goal is to find the indoor temperature \\(T\\) that minimizes total cost. 1. Write down the cost function \\[ C(T) = 1(T - 10)^2 + 3(T - 22)^2. \\] Combine terms: \\[ C(T) = (T - 10)^2 + 3(T - 22)^2. \\] 2. Compute the derivative \\(C&#39;(T)\\) Differentiate: \\[ C&#39;(T) = 2(T - 10) + 6(T - 22). \\] Simplify: \\[ C&#39;(T) = 2T - 20 + 6T - 132 = 8T - 152. \\] 3. Find the critical point by solving \\(C&#39;(T) = 0\\) \\[ 8T - 152 = 0 \\] \\[ T = \\frac{152}{8} = 19. \\] Critical point: \\[ \\boxed{T = 19^\\circ \\text{C}} \\] 4. Second derivative test \\[ C&#39;&#39;(T) = 8. \\] Since \\(8 &gt; 0\\), the function is concave up → the critical point is a minimum. 5. Interpretation Heating to \\(22^\\circ \\text{C}\\) is comfortable but expensive. Keeping the building at the outdoor temperature \\(10^\\circ \\text{C}\\) is cheap but uncomfortable. The optimum at 19°C represents the best tradeoff between energy use and comfort. This differs from the constrained-treatment example: Here the optimum arises from balancing competing factors — not from constraints. 6. Visualization The plot below shows the cost curve and the optimal setpoint. 6.9 Interpreting and Communicating Solutions Finding an optimum mathematically is only half the process. Effective environmental decision-making requires interpreting the result within its ecological, physical, and policy context. 6.9.1 Meaning of the optimal value Students must ask: Does this value make sense biologically or physically? What assumptions were made? What does the optimum represent in the real system? An optimal harvest level mathematically might occur at a population size below the reproductive threshold. Such a solution would be dismissed in practice. 6.9.2 Sensitivity to system changes Environmental systems are rarely static. Parameters such as rainfall, temperature, costs, pollutant loads, and species interactions change over time. Good practice includes examining how the optimum shifts when: coefficients change, constraints tighten or loosen, environmental conditions vary, or models incorporate uncertainty. This is especially important when the optimum lies near a boundary, where slight perturbations can dramatically change feasibility. 6.9.3 When mathematically optimal solutions are unrealistic Sometimes the optimum suggests impossible or undesirable actions: Releasing more water than exists in the reservoir. Planting trees at densities that exceed physical spacing limits. Harvesting at levels that lead to population collapse. Operating equipment outside safe ranges. Students must learn that mathematical solutions require ecological judgment before being implemented. 6.9.4 Guiding environmental decisions Optimization is most powerful when interpreted thoughtfully: It identifies tradeoffs clearly. It prioritizes efficient and sustainable choices. It highlights whether additional investment yields meaningful improvement. It provides a transparent basis for policy, engineering, or management actions. Ultimately, the goal of calculus-based optimization is not only to compute a number, but to use mathematical insight to support better decisions in managing environmental systems. 6.10 Summary: The Big Ideas of Optimization Optimization is finding the best outcome under constraints. Derivatives identify where systems change direction or balance forces. Endpoints and constraints matter just as much as internal critical points. Environmental interpretation is essential — the optimum must make sense physically. Optimization integrates all major calculus tools: derivatives, sign charts, concavity, limits, and modeling. 6.11 Practice: Optimization in Environmental Systems Work through the following problems to develop fluency in identifying variables, building objective functions, applying derivatives, and interpreting results. 1. Optimal Tree Spacing A restoration site plans to plant native trees in rows. Growth per tree is modeled as: \\[ G(d) = 10d - d^2, \\] where \\(d\\) is spacing in meters. a) Find the spacing that maximizes growth. b) Interpret the result. Show Solution We differentiate: \\[ G&#39;(d) = 10 - 2d. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 10 - 2d = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad d = 5. \\] Since \\(G(d)\\) is a downward-opening parabola (coefficient of \\(d^2\\) is \\(-1\\)), this critical point is a maximum. Answer: Maximum growth per tree occurs at \\(d = 5\\) m. Interpretation: If trees are closer than 5 m, competition reduces growth. If they are farther apart than 5 m, there is unused space/light. The 5 m spacing balances competition and resource use. 2. Minimizing Edge Habitat Loss A rectangular wildlife enclosure must have a fixed perimeter of 200 m. Interior area supports habitat; long edges increase disturbance. Your task is to determine the rectangle dimensions that maximize interior area (and thus minimize edge habitat per area). a) Write expressions for the perimeter \\(P\\) in terms of side lengths \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and the area \\(A(x, y)\\). b) Use the perimeter constraint to write \\(A\\) as a function of one variable only. c) Differentiate your formula and find the critical point that maximizes area. d) What are the optimal dimensions? e) Why is this shape ecologically preferred? Show Solution Step 1 — Set up the relationships For a rectangle: \\[ P = 2x + 2y = 200. \\] Solve for \\(y\\): \\[ y = 100 - x. \\] Area: \\[ A = xy. \\] Step 2 — Express area in a single variable Substitute \\(y = 100 - x\\): \\[ A(x) = x(100 - x) = 100x - x^2. \\] Step 3 — Differentiate and classify the critical point Differentiate the area function: \\[ A&#39;(x) = 100 - 2x. \\] Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points: \\[ 100 - 2x = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = 50. \\] Then compute the corresponding value of \\(y\\): \\[ y = 100 - x = 50. \\] Second-derivative (curvature) check Differentiate again: \\[ A&#39;&#39;(x) = -2. \\] Since \\[ A&#39;&#39;(x) = -2 &lt; 0, \\] the area function is concave down for all \\(x\\). A concave-down curve has a hill shape, meaning the critical point at \\(x = 50\\) is a maximum. Thus the rectangle with maximum area (and therefore minimum edge per unit area) occurs at: \\[ x = y = 50 \\text{ m}. \\] Step 4 — Identify the shape Since \\(x = y = 50\\), the maximum-area rectangle is a square. Interpretation For a fixed perimeter: the square has the largest interior area, and therefore the least edge habitat per unit area. Ecologically, this means: less disturbance along boundaries, more protected interior habitat, better conditions for species sensitive to edge effects. 3. Fastest Algal Growth Temperature Algal growth rate is modeled as: \\[ R(T) = T(30 - T), \\] for temperature \\(T\\) in °C. a) Find the temperature that maximizes growth. b) Explain the ecological meaning. Show Solution Differentiate: \\[ R&#39;(T) = 30 - 2T. \\] Set the derivative equal to zero: \\[ 30 - 2T = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad T = 15^\\circ\\text{C}. \\] Now check the second derivative to classify the critical point: \\[ R&#39;&#39;(T) = -2. \\] Because \\[ R&#39;&#39;(15) = -2 &lt; 0, \\] the function is concave down at \\(T = 15^\\circ\\text{C}\\), confirming that this point is a local (and global) maximum. Thus, the reaction rate is maximized at \\[ \\boxed{T = 15^\\circ\\text{C}}. \\] Interpretation: Algae grow fastest at a moderate, optimal temperature. Lower temperatures slow metabolism; higher ones cause heat stress or enzyme denaturation. 4. Minimizing Pollution Transport Time In treatment wetlands and natural channels, water depth strongly influences flow speed, which in turn affects how long pollutants remain in the system. Faster water reduces residence time, flushing contaminants quickly; slower water increases retention, which can improve natural treatment but may also prolong exposure. Suppose flow speed (m/s) depends on depth \\(h\\) (m) according to: \\[ v(h) = 2h - h^2. \\] This simplified model captures two competing effects: - At very shallow depths, water cannot move quickly. - At very large depths, friction and cross-sectional resistance slow the flow. - Somewhere in between is a depth where flow is fastest. a) Find the depth that maximizes flow speed. b) Explain what this depth implies about pollutant retention or removal effectiveness. Show Solution Differentiate: \\[ v&#39;(h) = 2 - 2h. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 2 - 2h = 0 \\Rightarrow h = 1. \\] Second derivative: \\[ v&#39;&#39;(h) = -2 &lt; 0, \\] so the function is concave down and \\(h=1\\) m gives the maximum speed. Interpretation: Water moves fastest at a depth of about 1 m. Shallower or deeper conditions reduce velocity and increase residence time. Depending on management goals, this could: enhance pollutant removal in treatment wetlands (longer residence = more settling/biodegradation), or slow down contaminant flushing in restoration channels (longer residence = delayed transport). Understanding the depth–velocity relationship helps managers tune wetland design for either retention or rapid transport, depending on context. 5. Optimal Foraging Time A shorebird feeding at an intertidal patch gains energy according to \\[ E(t) = \\frac{15t}{t+3}, \\] where \\(t\\) is the time spent at the patch (\\(t \\ge 0\\)). Early on, food is abundant and easy to find, but as the bird stays longer, the patch becomes depleted and gain rate slows. a) Use derivatives to analyze how \\(E(t)\\) changes with time. b) Determine whether a finite time \\(t\\) maximizes \\(E(t)\\) on the interval \\([0,\\infty)\\). c) Interpret the result in an ecological context. Show Solution Step 1 — Differentiate \\(E(t)\\) Start directly with: \\[ E(t) = \\frac{15t}{t+3}. \\] Use the quotient rule: \\[ E&#39;(t) = \\frac{(15)(t+3) - 15t(1)}{(t+3)^2} = \\frac{15t + 45 - 15t}{(t+3)^2} = \\frac{45}{(t+3)^2}. \\] Since \\((t+3)^2 &gt; 0\\) for all \\(t \\ge 0\\), \\[ \\boxed{E&#39;(t) &gt; 0\\ \\text{for all } t \\ge 0}. \\] Thus, \\(E(t)\\) is increasing for all allowable times. Step 2 — Curvature Check with \\(E&#39;&#39;(t)\\) Differentiate again: \\[ E&#39;&#39;(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[\\frac{45}{(t+3)^2}\\right] = 45 \\cdot (-2)(t+3)^{-3} = -\\frac{90}{(t+3)^3}. \\] Since \\((t+3)^3 &gt; 0\\), \\[ \\boxed{E&#39;&#39;(t) &lt; 0\\ \\text{for all } t \\ge 0}. \\] This means: The function is concave down everywhere Gains continue to increase, but with diminishing returns Step 3 — Does a maximum occur at a finite \\(t\\)? Take the limit: \\[ \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} E(t) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{15t}{t+3} = 15. \\] So: \\(E(t)\\) approaches 15 but never exceeds 15 and never has a critical point (since \\(E&#39;(t) \\neq 0\\)) \\[ \\boxed{\\text{No finite } t \\text{ maximizes } E(t) \\text{ on } [0,\\infty).} \\] The supremum (maximum value approached) is: \\[ \\sup E(t) = 15. \\] Interpretation Energy gain rate always increases with time spent at the patch. However, the marginal gain (slope) drops quickly — this is diminishing returns. Real birds do not stay indefinitely because they face constraints: travel time to the next patch increasing predation risk over time tidal windows daily energy/time budgets Ecologically, the bird should leave when the marginal gain falls below the benefit of switching patches. The calculus here shows the biological pattern: always increasing but flattening out, which is exactly the diminishing-return structure assumed in optimal foraging theory. 6. Sustainable Harvest Timing A recovering fish population grows according to \\[ P(t) = -t^3 + 6t^2, \\] where \\(t\\) is the number of years since protection began. Harvesting is assumed to begin only when the population reaches its maximum. Your goal is to determine when that maximum occurs, using derivatives. a) Find the time \\(t\\) that maximizes the population. b) Interpret the result ecologically. Show Solution Step 1 — Differentiate to find critical points \\[ P&#39;(t) = -3t^2 + 12t. \\] Factor: \\[ P&#39;(t) = -3t(t - 4). \\] Critical points occur when \\[ P&#39;(t) = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad t = 0,\\; 4. \\] Both are feasible times since protection began. Step 2 — Use the second derivative to classify max/min Differentiate again: \\[ P&#39;&#39;(t) = -6t + 12. \\] Evaluate: At \\(t = 0\\): \\[ P&#39;&#39;(0) = 12 &gt; 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\text{local **minimum**.} \\] At \\(t = 4\\): \\[ P&#39;&#39;(4) = -24 + 12 = -12 &lt; 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\text{local **maximum**.} \\] Thus the population (and therefore the sustainable harvest timing) is maximized at: \\[ \\boxed{t = 4 \\text{ years}} \\] Step 3 — Compute the maximum population \\[ P(4) = -(4^3) + 6(4^2) = -64 + 96 = 32. \\] Interpretation Very early in recovery (\\(t = 0\\)), the population is small — harvesting would undermine recovery. The population peaks around 4 years, providing the best ecological moment to begin harvesting. Waiting too long risks drawing from a declining population, which could reduce long-term sustainability. This example shows how derivatives help identify when a system reaches its biological peak, guiding more sustainable management decisions. 7. Minimizing Irrigation Waste Crop growth responds strongly to irrigation, but the relationship is rarely linear. At low irrigation, plants are water-limited and yield is low. At high irrigation, soils can become waterlogged, nutrients leach out, and roots lose oxygen — reducing yield again. A simple model of net water benefit (yield gains minus losses from over-watering) is: \\[ W(x) = 40 + 10x - x^2, \\] where: \\(x\\) = irrigation intensity (in consistent units), \\(W(x)\\) = net benefit to crop productivity. Your goal is to find the irrigation level that maximizes crop benefit while minimizing wasted water. a) Find the irrigation level \\(x\\) that maximizes \\(W(x)\\). b) Explain why both too little and too much irrigation reduce the benefit. Show Solution Differentiate: \\[ W&#39;(x) = 10 - 2x. \\] Set the derivative equal to zero: \\[ 10 - 2x = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = 5. \\] Check curvature with the second derivative: \\[ W&#39;&#39;(x) = -2. \\] Since \\(W&#39;&#39;(x) = -2 &lt; 0\\), the graph is concave down, confirming a maximum at \\(x = 5\\). Interpretation: When \\(x &lt; 5\\), plants do not receive enough water, and added irrigation improves growth. When \\(x &gt; 5\\), over-watering harms plants or wastes irrigation resources, reducing net benefit. The value \\(x = 5\\) identifies the “sweet spot” where water is used efficiently and yield is highest. This reflects a common agricultural principle: &gt; Optimal irrigation balances plant water needs with soil capacity and avoids waste. 8. Maximizing Carbon Storage Per-hectare carbon storage: \\[ C(d) = 50d - 4d^2, \\] where \\(d\\) is planting density in hundreds of trees per hectare. a) Find the density that maximizes carbon storage. b) Explain the tradeoff. Show Solution Differentiate: \\[ C&#39;(d) = 50 - 8d. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 50 - 8d = 0 \\Rightarrow d = \\frac{50}{8} = 6.25. \\] This is a concave-down quadratic ⇒ maximum at \\(d = 6.25\\). Since \\(d\\) is in hundreds of trees per hectare, optimal density ≈ 625 trees/ha. Interpretation: Low densities underuse space and light; very high densities cause strong competition and mortality. The optimal density balances these, maximizing total stand carbon. 9. Balancing Hydropower vs. Habitat Flow Hydropower from a dam: \\[ P(Q) = 5Q - 0.1Q^2, \\] where \\(Q\\) is release rate (m³/s). Habitat constraint: \\[ Q \\ge 10 \\quad \\text{(minimum flow for fish)}. \\] a) Find the unconstrained optimal \\(Q\\). b) Find the optimal feasible release given the constraint. c) Interpret. Show Solution Differentiate: \\[ P&#39;(Q) = 5 - 0.2Q. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 5 - 0.2Q = 0 \\Rightarrow Q = \\frac{5}{0.2} = 25. \\] Because the quadratic has a negative leading coefficient, this is a maximum. Feasible domain: \\(Q \\ge 10\\). The unconstrained optimum \\(Q = 25\\) is within the feasible set. So the optimal feasible release is \\(Q = 25\\) m³/s. Interpretation: Here, the ecological constraint \\(Q \\ge 10\\) doesn’t change the optimum—hydropower is maximized at a habitat-safe flow. In other contexts, the unconstrained optimum might violate habitat needs, in which case operators would be forced to choose a boundary flow that satisfies ecological requirements. 10. Maximizing Soil Carbon Storage Under Depth Limits Soil organic carbon increases with depth, but only up to a point. Beyond a certain depth, microbial activity and compaction reduce additional carbon gains. A simple model for carbon stored (in kg/m²) as a function of soil depth \\(d\\) (in meters) is: \\[ S(d) = 4d^3 - 30d^2 + 60d. \\] However, the site has a physical excavation limit: \\[ 0 \\le d \\le 5. \\] a) Find all critical points of \\(S(d)\\) on \\([0,5]\\). b) Evaluate \\(S(d)\\) at the critical points and at the domain endpoints. c) Identify the depth that maximizes carbon storage. d) Explain why the boundary, not the critical point, is optimal. Show Solution (a) Find all critical points on \\([0,5]\\) Differentiate: \\[ S&#39;(d) = 12d^2 - 60d + 60. \\] Solve: \\[ 12d^2 - 60d + 60 = 0. \\] Divide by 12: \\[ d^2 - 5d + 5 = 0. \\] Quadratic formula: \\[ d = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 20}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}. \\] Approximate critical points: \\(d_1 \\approx 1.382\\) \\(d_2 \\approx 3.618\\) Both lie inside \\([0,5]\\). (b) Evaluate \\(S(d)\\) at critical points and endpoints Endpoints: \\[ S(0) = 0 \\] \\[ S(5) = 4(5^3) - 30(5^2) + 60(5) = 500 - 750 + 300 = 50. \\] Critical point values: At \\(d_1 \\approx 1.382\\): \\(d_1^2 \\approx 1.909\\) \\(d_1^3 \\approx 2.641\\) \\[ S(d_1) \\approx 4(2.641) - 30(1.909) + 60(1.382) \\] \\[ \\approx 10.564 - 57.27 + 82.92 = 36.21. \\] At \\(d_2 \\approx 3.618\\): \\(d_2^2 \\approx 13.089\\) \\(d_2^3 \\approx 47.376\\) \\[ S(d_2) \\approx 4(47.376) - 30(13.089) + 60(3.618) \\] \\[ \\approx 189.50 - 392.67 + 217.08 = 13.91. \\] (c) Identify the maximum Comparing all values: Depth \\(d\\) \\(S(d)\\) (kg/m²) \\(0\\) \\(0\\) \\(1.382\\) \\(36.21\\) \\(3.618\\) \\(13.91\\) \\(5\\) 50 (largest) \\[ \\boxed{\\text{Maximum carbon storage occurs at } d = 5\\ \\text{m}.} \\] (d) Why the boundary, not the critical point, is optimal? Check curvature: \\[ S&#39;&#39;(d) = 24d - 60. \\] \\(S&#39;&#39;(1.382) = 24(1.382) - 60 \\approx -26.8 &lt; 0\\) → local maximum \\(S&#39;&#39;(3.618) = 24(3.618) - 60 \\approx 26.8 &gt; 0\\) → local minimum Although \\(d \\approx 1.382\\) gives a local maximum, it is not the largest value on the interval. Because the feasible domain is restricted to \\(0 \\le d \\le 5\\), the global maximum occurs at the endpoint \\(d = 5\\). Interpretation: Even though the carbon curve has a small “hump” near 1.38 m, the site allows digging deeper. Since carbon continues increasing toward the boundary, the physical constraint determines the optimum—not the calculus critical point. This illustrates a key optimization theme: Under domain limits, the global optimum often occurs at a boundary, even when interior critical points exist. 6.12 More Optimization Practice Problems 1. Tree Spacing to Maximize Growth In a large-scale reforestation project, foresters want to optimize the spacing between newly planted trees. If trees are too close, they compete for resources; if too far apart, overall canopy productivity declines. Let: \\(d\\): distance to nearest tree (m) \\(G(d)\\): tree growth rate (cm/year) Growth model: \\[ G(d) = 40d - 2d^2. \\] Your Task Find the spacing \\(d\\) that maximizes tree growth. Confirm it is a maximum using the second derivative. Interpret why this spacing is ecologically ideal. Show Solution Step 1: Differentiate \\[ G&#39;(d) = 40 - 4d. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 40 - 4d = 0 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad d = 10. \\] Step 2: Confirm maximum \\[ G&#39;&#39;(d) = -4 &lt; 0, \\] so \\(d = 10\\) m maximizes growth. Interpretation Ten meters gives enough spacing to reduce competition while maintaining canopy structure. 2. River-Edge Wildlife Reserve: Maximize Area A wildlife refuge is establishing a rectangular habitat enclosure along a straight riverbank. Because the river forms one boundary, fencing is needed on three sides only. Let: \\(x\\): width (perpendicular to river) \\(y\\): length (parallel to river) Fencing available: 600 m Constraint: \\[ 2x + y = 600. \\] Area: \\[ A = xy. \\] Your Task Rewrite area \\(A\\) in one variable. Find the dimensions maximizing area. Explain why these dimensions give the largest possible habitat. Show Solution Step 1: Substitute \\[ y = 600 - 2x. \\] \\[ A(x) = 600x - 2x^2. \\] Step 2: Differentiate \\[ A&#39;(x) = 600 - 4x = 0 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad x = 150. \\] \\[ y = 600 - 300 = 300. \\] Result \\(x = 150\\) m \\(y = 300\\) m 3. Cylindrical Aquatic Tank: Minimizing Surface Area A greenhouse uses an open-top cylindrical tank to grow aquatic plants. Because material and heating costs increase with total surface area, the team wants to design the tank with the smallest possible surface area while still holding 500 m³ of water. Let: \\(r\\): radius (meters) \\(h\\): height (meters) Volume constraint: \\[ V = \\pi r^2 h = 500. \\] Surface area for an open-top tank: \\[ A = \\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r h. \\] Your Task Use the volume constraint to express \\(A\\) as a function of one variable. Find the radius \\(r\\) that minimizes surface area. Compute the corresponding height \\(h\\). Provide numerical values (in meters). Show Solution Step 1: Use the constraint to eliminate \\(h\\) From the volume: \\[ h = \\frac{500}{\\pi r^2}. \\] Substitute into surface area: \\[ A(r) = \\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r\\left(\\frac{500}{\\pi r^2}\\right) = \\pi r^2 + \\frac{1000}{r}. \\] Thus: \\[ A(r) = \\pi r^2 + \\frac{1000}{r}. \\] Step 2: Differentiate and find critical points \\[ A&#39;(r) = 2\\pi r - \\frac{1000}{r^2}. \\] Set derivative equal to zero: \\[ 2\\pi r - \\frac{1000}{r^2} = 0. \\] Multiply by \\(r^2\\): \\[ 2\\pi r^3 = 1000. \\] \\[ r^3 = \\frac{500}{\\pi}. \\] \\[ \\boxed{r = \\left(\\frac{500}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/3}}. \\] Numerically: \\[ r \\approx 5.43 \\text{ m}. \\] Step 3: Second derivative test (check min vs. max) Differentiate again: \\[ A&#39;&#39;(r) = 2\\pi + \\frac{2000}{r^3}. \\] Since \\(r &gt; 0\\), both terms are positive: \\[ A&#39;&#39;(r) &gt; 0 \\quad \\text{for all } r &gt; 0. \\] Conclusion: The critical point occurs where the function is concave up, so it is a minimum. Step 4: Compute corresponding height \\[ h = \\frac{500}{\\pi r^2}. \\] \\[ r^2 \\approx 5.43^2 \\approx 29.49. \\] \\[ h \\approx \\frac{500}{3.14159 \\cdot 29.49} \\approx \\frac{500}{92.66} \\approx 5.40 \\text{ m}. \\] Final Optimal Dimensions Radius: \\[ \\boxed{r \\approx 5.43\\ \\text{m}} \\] Height: \\[ \\boxed{h \\approx 5.40\\ \\text{m}} \\] Interpretation Because the second derivative is always positive, surface area is minimized at this single critical point. The optimal open-top tank is almost perfectly balanced in height and radius, which minimizes material use while maintaining the required volume. 4. Marine Protected Area: Balancing Biodiversity Gains and Patrol Costs Marine protected areas (MPAs) enhance biodiversity and stabilize fisheries, but larger MPAs require more boundary monitoring. Managers must balance biodiversity benefits with enforcement cost limits. Suppose the conservation team is designing a circular MPA. Let: \\(r\\): radius of the MPA (km) Biodiversity benefit model: \\[ B(r) = 120r^2 - 5r^3 \\] where the quadratic term reflects increasing habitat benefits with area, and the cubic term models diminishing returns from overly large MPAs. Patrol cost (proportional to boundary length): \\[ C(r) = 20{,}000(2\\pi r) \\] Maximum annual enforcement budget: $500,000 Budget constraint: \\[ C(r) \\le 500{,}000. \\] Your Task Use the budget constraint to find the maximum feasible radius \\(r_{\\max}\\). Maximize the biodiversity function \\(B(r)\\) and find its critical point. Determine whether the optimal radius is feasible given the enforcement budget. Explain the ecological meaning of diminishing returns and why “bigger is not always better.” Show Solution Step 1: Apply the budget constraint \\[ 20{,}000(2\\pi r) = 500{,}000 \\] \\[ 40{,}000\\pi r = 500{,}000 \\] \\[ r_{\\max} = \\frac{500{,}000}{40{,}000\\pi} = \\frac{12.5}{\\pi} \\approx 3.98\\ \\text{km}. \\] So the radius cannot exceed 3.98 km. Step 2: Maximize the biodiversity function \\[ B(r) = 120r^2 - 5r^3. \\] Differentiate: \\[ B&#39;(r) = 240r - 15r^2 = 15r(16 - r). \\] Critical points: \\[ r = 0, \\quad r = 16. \\] Ignore \\(r=0\\). The biological optimum is: \\[ r^* = 16\\ \\text{km}. \\] To verify this is a maximum, compute the second derivative: \\[ B&#39;&#39;(r) = 240 - 30r. \\] Evaluate at the critical point: \\[ B&#39;&#39;(16) = 240 - 480 = -240 &lt; 0. \\] Thus \\(r = 16\\) km is indeed a maximum for biodiversity benefit. Step 3: Check feasibility Even though \\(r^* = 16\\) km maximizes biodiversity, it exceeds the budget-limited radius: \\[ r_{\\max} \\approx 3.98\\ \\text{km}. \\] So the MPA cannot be built at the biological optimum. The best feasible radius is therefore: \\[ \\boxed{r = r_{\\max} \\approx 3.98\\ \\text{km}}. \\] Step 4: Compute biodiversity at the feasible radius \\[ B(r_{\\max}) = 120(3.98)^2 - 5(3.98)^3. \\] \\[ 3.98^2 \\approx 15.84,\\qquad 3.98^3 \\approx 63.13. \\] \\[ B(r_{\\max}) \\approx 1900.8 - 315.65 \\approx 1585.2. \\] Interpretation The biological optimum (16 km) lies far outside what the enforcement budget can support. The term \\(-5r^3\\) models diminishing returns: very large MPAs provide less additional biodiversity benefit per km². Because surveillance cost grows with perimeter, the budget—not ecology—limits final MPA size. The optimal feasible design is therefore the largest radius allowed by the budget constraint, here about 3.98 km. This mirrors real-world MPA planning: ecological goals often exceed available financial resources. 5. Circular Irrigation System: Minimizing Total Water Cost A farmer is installing a center-pivot circular irrigation system to water a field. Larger irrigation radii water more land, but they also become less efficient: the outer sprinklers must operate at higher pressure, water evaporates more during spraying, and runoff losses increase. As a result, the cost per unit area increases with radius. Let: \\(r\\): radius of the irrigated field (meters) \\(C(r)\\): cost per unit area (dollars per square meter) \\(T(r)\\): total irrigation cost (dollars) Cost per unit area increases linearly with radius: \\[ C(r) = 100 + 0.5r. \\] Since the area of the irrigated region is \\(\\pi r^2\\), the total cost is: \\[ T(r) = (\\pi r^2)(100 + 0.5r). \\] This creates a tradeoff: a larger radius waters more land but has much higher marginal cost, while a smaller radius waters less land but is more efficient. Your Task Differentiate \\(T(r)\\) to find any critical points. Which ones make sense? Use the second derivative to determine whether a minimum exists. Provide a practical recommendation to the farmer based on the mathematics and context. Show Solution Step 1: Expand the total cost function (optional for clarity) \\[ T(r) = \\pi r^2(100 + 0.5r) = 100\\pi r^2 + 0.5\\pi r^3. \\] This form makes differentiation easier. Step 2: Differentiate to find critical points \\[ T&#39;(r) = 200\\pi r + 1.5\\pi r^2. \\] Factor: \\[ T&#39;(r) = \\pi r(200 + 1.5r). \\] Set \\(T&#39;(r) = 0\\): \\[ \\pi r(200 + 1.5r) = 0. \\] Critical points occur when: \\(r = 0\\) \\(200 + 1.5r = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad r = -\\frac{200}{1.5} \\approx -133.3\\) Interpretation: - \\(r = 0\\) is not physically meaningful for an irrigation system. - The only other critical point is negative and therefore infeasible. Thus there are no positive-radius critical points. Step 3: Use the second derivative to determine behavior Differentiate again: \\[ T&#39;&#39;(r) = 200\\pi + 3\\pi r. \\] For all \\(r &gt; 0\\): \\[ T&#39;&#39;(r) = 200\\pi + 3\\pi r &gt; 0. \\] Since \\(T&#39;&#39;(r) &gt; 0\\) for every positive radius, the function is: Always increasing Strictly concave up This means there is no interior minimum for \\(r &gt; 0\\). Conclusion and Practical Recommendation Because \\(T(r)\\) increases for every positive \\(r\\): The smallest radius produces the lowest total cost, Larger radii are always more expensive because both area and inefficiency grow with radius. Recommendation: Use the smallest feasible radius permitted by the irrigation equipment and agricultural needs. This aligns with the model: expanding irrigation radius increases cost at an accelerating rate. 6. Understory Light Optimization in a Forest Restoration Project In ecological restoration work, the spacing of canopy trees is crucial for determining the amount of light that reaches the understory. If trees are planted too closely, the canopy closes too quickly and shades out young shrubs, forbs, and tree seedlings. If spacing is too wide, the site may become dominated by invasive grasses, and the developing forest may lose structural complexity. To explore this tradeoff, a restoration team models the percent of full sunlight reaching the understory as a function of the distance \\(d\\) (in meters) between canopy trees: \\[ L(d) = 60d - 3d^2. \\] The linear term \\(60d\\) reflects the increase in light availability as canopy trees are spaced further apart. The quadratic term \\(-3d^2\\) captures the diminishing returns and eventual decline: if trees are too far apart, understory plants may be exposed to excessive light, drying out soil and harming shade-tolerant species. The goal is to find the optimal spacing for maximizing usable understory light. Your Task Find the spacing \\(d\\) that maximizes understory light availability. Confirm the result using the second derivative test. Explain why this spacing makes ecological sense. Show Solution Step 1: Differentiate to find critical points \\[ L(d) = 60d - 3d^2. \\] \\[ L&#39;(d) = 60 - 6d. \\] Set the derivative equal to zero: \\[ 60 - 6d = 0 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad 6d = 60 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad d = 10\\ \\text{meters}. \\] This is the candidate for maximum light availability. Step 2: Apply the second derivative test \\[ L&#39;&#39;(d) = -6. \\] Because: \\[ L&#39;&#39;(10) = -6 &lt; 0, \\] the function is concave down at the critical point. Therefore, \\(d = 10\\) meters gives a local (and global) maximum for understory light. Step 3: Ecological Interpretation At smaller spacings (e.g., 4–6 m), canopy trees shade each other, reducing understory light. At larger spacings (e.g., 14–18 m), the site becomes too exposed, drying soil and stressing shade-adapted forest species. The model suggests that 10 meters strikes the best balance—enough canopy separation to let light penetrate, but not so much that understory vegetation becomes overexposed. This result aligns with many forest restoration guidelines, where 8–12 m spacing is often recommended to maximize diversity of shade-tolerant plants, early successional shrubs, and tree seedlings. 7. Compost Bin With Square Base: Minimizing Construction Cost A community garden is building a compost bin to process food scraps and plant material. The bin will have: a square base of side length \\(l\\) (meters) four rectangular sides of height \\(h\\) (meters) no lid, to allow oxygen flow a required volume of 1.5 m³ Because the compost is heavy, the base must be built from a stronger, more expensive material. The sides can be made from a lighter, cheaper material. Material costs: Base: $30 per m² Sides: $20 per m² Volume constraint: \\[ l^2 h = 1.5. \\] Your Task Build the total cost function yourself: compute the cost of the base, compute the cost of all four sides, combine them into one expression \\(C(l, h)\\). Use the volume constraint to rewrite your cost function in a single variable. Differentiate to find the cost-minimizing base length \\(l\\). Compute the corresponding height \\(h\\). Use the second derivative test to confirm that you found a minimum. Interpret why these dimensions minimize material cost. Show Solution Step 1: Build the cost function Base area = \\(l^2\\), cost = \\(30l^2\\). Each side has area \\(lh\\), and there are 4 sides. Cost of sides: \\[ 4lh \\cdot 20 = 80lh. \\] Total cost: \\[ C(l, h) = 30l^2 + 80lh. \\] Step 2: Use the volume constraint to eliminate \\(h\\) Volume requirement: \\[ l^2 h = 1.5 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad h = \\frac{1.5}{l^2}. \\] Substitute into the cost function: \\[ C(l) = 30l^2 + 80l\\left(\\frac{1.5}{l^2}\\right) = 30l^2 + \\frac{120}{l}. \\] Step 3: Differentiate to find the critical point \\[ C&#39;(l) = 60l - \\frac{120}{l^2}. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 60l - \\frac{120}{l^2} = 0. \\] Rearrange: \\[ 60l = \\frac{120}{l^2} \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad l^3 = 2. \\] \\[ l = \\sqrt[3]{2} \\approx 1.26\\ \\text{m}. \\] Step 4: Compute the corresponding height \\[ h = \\frac{1.5}{l^2} = \\frac{1.5}{(\\sqrt[3]{2})^2} \\approx 0.94\\ \\text{m}. \\] Step 5: Second derivative test \\[ C&#39;&#39;(l) = 60 + \\frac{240}{l^3}. \\] For any \\(l &gt; 0\\), both terms are positive: \\[ C&#39;&#39;(l) &gt; 0. \\] Therefore the critical point is a minimum. Final Cost-Minimizing Dimensions Base length: \\[ l \\approx 1.26\\ \\text{m} \\] Height: \\[ h \\approx 0.94\\ \\text{m} \\] Interpretation The base is made from the more expensive material, so the optimal design avoids making it too large. However, making \\(l\\) too small forces the height \\(h\\) to increase rapidly, which increases the total side-wall area. The optimal point balances: more expensive base area vs. less expensive side area. This tradeoff produces a bin that is slightly wider than it is tall, minimizing total material cost while still achieving the required volume. 8. Wetland Buffer Optimization With 3-Sided Fence Wetland buffers protect water quality, filter stormwater, provide habitat, and support nutrient cycling. A conservation team is constructing a rectangular wetland buffer along a riverbank. Because the river forms one boundary, fencing is needed on only three sides: one length (parallel to the river), and two widths (perpendicular to the river). They have 90 meters of fencing. Let: \\(x\\): width of the buffer (m) \\(y\\): length of the buffer along the river (m) The ecological benefit of the buffer is modeled as: \\[ B(x, y) = 3xy - x^3, \\] where: \\(3xy\\) represents increasing ecological services as buffer area grows \\(-x^3\\) represents diminishing wetland function if the buffer becomes too wide, transitioning into upland habitat Your Task Create the fencing constraint yourself. Use the fact that the buffer has two widths and one length to build an equation relating \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and the available fencing (90 m). Solve your constraint for \\(y\\). Substitute the constraint into \\(B(x,y)\\) to rewrite the benefit as a function of one variable, \\(B(x)\\). Find the width \\(x\\) that maximizes ecological benefit. Use the second derivative test to confirm it is a maximum. Compute the corresponding optimal length \\(y\\). Explain why this combination of dimensions makes ecological sense. Show Solution Step 1: Student-generated constraint Three sides require fencing: two widths: \\(x + x = 2x\\) one length: \\(y\\) Total fencing is 90 m: \\[ 2x + y = 90. \\] Solve for \\(y\\): \\[ y = 90 - 2x. \\] Step 2: Substitute into the benefit function \\[ B(x) = 3x(90 - 2x) - x^3. \\] Expand: \\[ B(x) = 270x - 6x^2 - x^3. \\] Step 3: Differentiate to find critical points \\[ B&#39;(x) = 270 - 12x - 3x^2. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 270 - 12x - 3x^2 = 0. \\] Divide by 3: \\[ 90 - 4x - x^2 = 0. \\] Rearrange: \\[ x^2 + 4x - 90 = 0. \\] Solve using the quadratic formula: \\[ x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 360}}{2} = -2 \\pm \\sqrt{94}. \\] Only the positive solution is meaningful: \\[ x = -2 + \\sqrt{94} \\approx -2 + 9.70 \\approx 7.70\\ \\text{m}. \\] Step 4: Second derivative test \\[ B&#39;&#39;(x) = -12 - 6x. \\] Evaluate at \\(x = 7.70\\): \\[ B&#39;&#39;(7.70) = -12 - 46.2 = -58.2 &lt; 0. \\] Since the second derivative is negative, the critical point is a maximum. Step 5: Compute the corresponding length \\[ y = 90 - 2x = 90 - 2(7.70) \\approx 90 - 15.4 \\approx 74.6\\ \\text{m}. \\] Final Optimal Buffer Dimensions Width: \\[ x \\approx 7.70\\ \\text{m} \\] Length: \\[ y \\approx 74.6\\ \\text{m} \\] Interpretation Increasing buffer size improves filtration, wildlife movement, and nutrient uptake. But very large widths push the buffer away from wetland conditions and into upland habitat, reducing wetland-specific ecological benefits. The model’s \\(-x^3\\) term captures habitat transition and diminishing returns, causing the benefit to peak at a moderate width. The optimal design is therefore long and moderately wide, which maximizes wetland function while fitting within the fencing limit. This pattern reflects real restoration practices: &gt; Long, continuous buffers near waterways often provide more ecological value than extremely wide buffers that extend far from the water’s edge. 9. Designing a Wildlife Corridor With Fixed Fencing Wildlife corridors help animals move safely between habitat patches, reducing fragmentation and supporting long-term population resilience. A conservation team is planning a rectangular wildlife corridor along the edge of a restored forest. The available land is flexible, but the project is strictly limited by the amount of fencing the team can afford. You are given: The corridor has length \\(L\\) (running east–west along the forest edge) The corridor has width \\(W\\) (extending into the restoration zone) The team has 300 meters of fencing total \\[ 2L + 2W = 300. \\] The expected ecological benefit of the corridor—based on species movement models and habitat suitability metrics—is: \\[ B(L, W) = 4LW - 0.05L^2. \\] This function reflects two interacting ecological effects: Increasing area (\\(LW\\)) increases movement opportunities and reduces isolation. Very long, narrow corridors decrease benefit (via the \\(-0.05L^2\\) term) because bottlenecks increase edge exposure and reduce effective habitat. Your Task Use the fencing constraint to rewrite the benefit function \\(B\\) in one variable. Find the dimensions \\((L, W)\\) that maximize biodiversity benefit. Briefly interpret the result in ecological terms: Does the optimal design prefer length or width? How does the fencing constraint shape the corridor layout? Show Solution Step 1: Use the constraint \\[ 2L + 2W = 300 \\Rightarrow W = 150 - L. \\] Step 2: Substitute into \\(B\\) \\[ B(L) = 4L(150 - L) - 0.05L^2 = 600L - 4L^2 - 0.05L^2 = 600L - 4.05L^2. \\] Step 3: Differentiate \\[ B&#39;(L) = 600 - 8.1L. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 600 - 8.1L = 0 \\Rightarrow L = \\frac{600}{8.1} \\approx 74.07. \\] Width: \\[ W = 150 - L \\approx 150 - 74.07 = 75.93. \\] Step 4: Interpretation A near-square shape maximizes benefit because it increases interior area relative to edge effects. Optimal dimensions: \\(L \\approx 74.1\\) m \\(W \\approx 75.9\\) m 10. Wetland Treatment Basin: Maximizing Pollutant Removal Constructed wetlands remove pollutants by slowing water and increasing contact with plants and microbes. An engineering team is designing a treatment basin whose performance depends on: Surface area \\(A\\) (m²) Average depth \\(d\\) (m) A simplified pollutant-removal model is: \\[ R(A, d) = A d - 3d + 10\\sqrt{d}. \\] Interpretation: \\(A d\\): more total water processed → more removal \\(-3d\\): very deep water reduces oxygen and light \\(10\\sqrt{d}\\): moderate depth boosts residence time with diminishing returns The basin must hold a fixed volume of 600 m³: \\[ A d = 600 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad A = \\frac{600}{d}. \\] Engineering guidelines require: \\[ d \\ge 1 \\quad \\text{(minimum safe depth)}. \\] Your Task Use the volume constraint to rewrite \\(R\\) in a single variable. Find the depth \\(d\\) that maximizes pollutant removal. Compute the corresponding surface area \\(A\\). Explain why the optimum falls inside the feasible region. Show Solution Step 1: Substitute the constraint \\[ R(d) = \\left(\\frac{600}{d}\\right)d - 3d + 10\\sqrt{d} = 600 - 3d + 10\\sqrt{d}. \\] Step 2: Differentiate \\[ R&#39;(d) = -3 + \\frac{10}{2\\sqrt{d}} = -3 + \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{d}}. \\] Set to zero: \\[ -3 + \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{d}} = 0 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{d}} = 3 \\] \\[ \\sqrt{d} = \\frac{5}{3} \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad d = \\frac{25}{9} \\approx 2.78. \\] This is within the feasible region \\(d \\ge 1\\). Step 3: Confirm it is a maximum Second derivative: \\[ R&#39;&#39;(d)= -\\frac{5}{2} d^{-3/2} &lt; 0 \\] for all \\(d &gt; 0\\), so the critical point is a global maximum on the feasible domain. Step 4: Compute the optimal area \\[ A^{*} = \\frac{600}{d^{*}} = \\frac{600}{25/9} = 600 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} = 216\\text{ m}^2. \\] Final Optimal Design Depth: \\[ d^{*} = \\frac{25}{9} \\approx 2.78 \\text{ m} \\] Area: \\[ A^{*} = 216 \\text{ m}^2 \\] "],["calculus-i-equation-sheet.html", "Calculus I Equation Sheet", " Calculus I Equation Sheet Basic Derivative Rules Rule Function Form Derivative Form Constant \\(c\\) \\(0\\) Power \\(x^n\\) \\(n x^{n-1}\\) Constant Multiple \\(c \\cdot f(x)\\) \\(c \\cdot f&#39;(x)\\) Sum \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x) + g&#39;(x)\\) Difference \\(f(x) - g(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x) - g&#39;(x)\\) Product \\(f(x)g(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x)g(x) + f(x)g&#39;(x)\\) Quotient \\(\\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\) \\(\\dfrac{f&#39;(x)g(x) - f(x)g&#39;(x)}{g(x)^2}\\) Chain \\(f(g(x))\\) \\(f&#39;(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x)\\) Inverse \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{1}{f&#39;(f^{-1}(x))}\\) Trigonometric Derivatives Function Derivative \\(\\sin x\\) \\(\\cos x\\) \\(\\cos x\\) \\(-\\sin x\\) \\(\\tan x\\) \\(\\sec^2 x\\) \\(\\sec x\\) \\(\\sec x \\tan x\\) \\(\\csc x\\) \\(-\\csc x \\cot x\\) \\(\\cot x\\) \\(-\\csc^2 x\\) Exponential &amp; Logarithmic Derivatives Function Derivative \\(a^x\\) \\(a^x \\ln(a)\\) \\(e^x\\) \\(e^x\\) \\(a^{g(x)}\\) \\(g&#39;(x)\\, a^{g(x)} \\ln(a)\\) \\(e^{g(x)}\\) \\(g&#39;(x)\\, e^{g(x)}\\) \\(\\log_a(x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{1}{x \\ln(a)}\\) \\(\\ln(x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{1}{x}\\) \\(\\log_a(g(x))\\) \\(\\dfrac{g&#39;(x)}{g(x)\\ln(a)}\\) \\(\\ln(g(x))\\) \\(\\dfrac{g&#39;(x)}{g(x)}\\) Average Rate of Change \\[ AV_[a,b] = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \\] Limit Definition of a Derivative \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] General Functions &amp; Forms Linear Forms: General: \\(f(x) = ax+b\\), Point-slope: \\(y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)\\), Slope-intercept: \\(y=mx+b\\) Quadratic Forms: General: \\(ax^2+bx+c\\), Vertex: \\(a(x-h)^2+k\\), Roots: \\(\\dfrac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\) Polynomial (nth-order): \\(f(x) = a_nx^n + \\dots + a_1x + a_0\\) Transformations: \\(g(x) = a f(x-b) + c\\) Sinusoid: \\(f(x) = a \\sin(kx+b)+c,\\ \\ T=\\dfrac{2\\pi}{k}\\) Applications Slope of tangent line: \\(m = f&#39;(a)\\) Tangent line equation: \\(y = f&#39;(a)(x-a)+f(a)\\) Linear approximation: \\(L(x)=f(a)+f&#39;(a)(x-a)\\) Related rates: \\(\\dfrac{dy}{dt} = \\dfrac{dy}{dx}\\cdot\\dfrac{dx}{dt}\\) Concavity: \\(f&#39;&#39;&gt;0 \\Rightarrow\\) concave up, \\(f&#39;&#39;&lt;0 \\Rightarrow\\) concave down Extrema: solve \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\), check sign of \\(f&#39;\\) or use \\(f&#39;&#39;\\) "],["test1-review-material.html", "Test1 Review Material Test Instructions Test 1 Spring 2025 Test 1 Spring 2025 Retake Test 1 Winter 2025 Practice Workbook: Limits, Continuity, and Derivatives Short-Answer Practice Problem Practice", " Test1 Review Material Below are resources to help you practice and prepare for the tests in this course Test 1 will cover the material covered in Chapter 3 of this textbook.

The equation sheet from the textbook is included as part of the test pack (it doesn’t count as note pages) Practice Short Answer If \\(f&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) on an interval, what does this tell you about how the environmental variable is behaving? Give an example of a real system that might show this pattern. Suggested Answer The variable is increasing on that interval. Examples include lake temperature rising through the morning, snowpack depth increasing during a storm, or early-stage population growth. A population model has a point where \\(P&#39;(t) = 0\\) but \\(P&#39;&#39;(t) &lt; 0\\). Explain what is happening biologically at that moment. Suggested Answer The population has reached a peak. Growth has slowed to zero, and the negative second derivative shows decline is beginning due to limits like resources or space. Why is an inflection point important in environmental systems? Describe a situation where identifying the moment when concavity changes could be useful. Suggested Answer An inflection point marks when the rate of change switches from accelerating to decelerating. Useful examples include algae transitioning from rapid bloom to nutrient-limited slowdown or a streamflow peak transitioning to recession. If a function has a horizontal asymptote as \\(x \\to +\\infty\\), what does that usually represent in ecological or physical models? Suggested Answer A long-term limiting value. Examples: carrying capacity, maximum nutrient uptake, equilibrium storage or temperature. A function has a vertical asymptote at \\(x = 3\\). What does this mean, and what environmental boundary might behave this way? Suggested Answer The function becomes undefined at \\(x=3\\) and approaches ±∞. Environmental analogies include thresholds like pore pressure reaching critical limits or denominators representing zero volume remaining. You are given only a derivative graph \\(f&#39;(x)\\). How can you determine where the original function is increasing or decreasing, has maxima/minima, or is concave up/down? Suggested Answer Increasing where \\(f&#39;&gt;0\\), decreasing where \\(f&#39;&lt;0\\). A max occurs where \\(f&#39;\\) changes +→– and a min where –→+. Concavity depends on whether \\(f&#39;\\) is rising (concave up) or falling (concave down). The second derivative of a function is positive for all \\(x\\). What does this tell you about the shape of the curve? Suggested Answer The function is concave up everywhere. This could represent accelerating recovery or compounding growth after disturbance. A logistic-style function changes concavity at exactly one value of \\(x\\). What does that point represent in system dynamics? Suggested Answer It is the inflection point—the moment of maximum growth rate, where growth switches from accelerating to slowing. If \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is always positive but decreases toward zero as \\(x \\to \\infty\\), how would the graph look? What real process behaves this way? Suggested Answer The function increases but levels off toward a horizontal asymptote. Examples include nutrient uptake saturation, long-term warming trends, or logistic population limits. An environmental dataset increases, then decreases, then increases again. What must the sign of the derivative look like? Suggested Answer The derivative must be +, then –, then +. Causes could include seasonal cycles, predator–prey oscillations, or storm hydrograph rise–fall–rise sequences. If two functions both satisfy \\(f&#39;(a)=0\\), must they have the same type of extremum at \\(x=a\\)? Explain. Suggested Answer No. A horizontal tangent could be a max, min, saddle, or flat point. The behavior depends on sign changes in \\(f&#39;\\) or on \\(f&#39;&#39;(a)\\). A function’s rate of change increases rapidly, then levels off. What does this say about \\(f&#39;\\) and \\(f&#39;&#39;\\)? Suggested Answer \\(f&#39;&gt;0\\) throughout. \\(f&#39;&#39;&gt;0\\) during the acceleration phase, then \\(f&#39;&#39;&lt;0\\) as growth slows. This is typical of logistic or saturation processes. In an environmental time series, what does it mean if \\(f&#39;&#39;(t) &lt; 0\\) while \\(f&#39;(t) &gt; 0\\)? Suggested Answer The variable is increasing but at a slowing rate. Examples: warming lake approaching equilibrium, population nearing carrying capacity. Suppose a function has an inflection point at \\(x=5\\). What does this tell you about system behavior on each side? Suggested Answer Concavity switches sign at 5. The system moves from accelerating to slowing change (or vice versa), marking a transition in dynamics. Why is a vertical asymptote different from a point where the derivative is undefined? Suggested Answer A vertical asymptote means the function itself blows up to ±∞. A derivative can be undefined even when the function is finite (corners, cusps). These reflect different structural vs. behavioral limitations. A streamflow model reaches a maximum at \\(t=7\\) hours. What does this say about the hydrologic process? Suggested Answer Before 7 hr, discharge increases; after, it decreases. This marks peak flow, when routing and inputs balance before recession dominates. A derivative graph shows a long flat region where \\(f&#39;(x) \\approx 0\\). What might this indicate? Suggested Answer The system is experiencing very little change. Examples: midday temperature plateau, stable soil moisture, population near carrying capacity. Why is the quadratic formula useful when analyzing derivatives? Suggested Answer Many derivatives simplify to quadratics. Finding extrema or inflection points requires solving \\(f&#39;=0\\) or \\(f&#39;&#39;=0\\), and the quadratic formula works even when factoring doesn’t. If a function always has a small but positive derivative, how would you describe the shape? Suggested Answer It increases gradually with no peaks or sharp transitions. Examples include slow climate warming, gradual biomass growth, or long-term CO₂ trends. A model has a horizontal asymptote at \\(y=120\\). What does this say about long-term system behavior? Suggested Answer The system approaches a stable upper limit, such as a carrying capacity, saturation level, or maximum equilibrium value. A function has \\[ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)=8. \\] What does this horizontal asymptote tell you about the long-term behavior of the system being modeled? Suggested Answer The system approaches and stabilizes around 8 as the input variable becomes very large. This represents a long-term equilibrium such as a carrying capacity, saturation point, or thermal equilibrium. Given \\[ f(x)=\\frac{5x}{x-4}, \\] identify the vertical asymptote and describe the behavior of the function as \\(x\\) approaches that asymptote from the left and from the right. Suggested Answer The vertical asymptote is at \\(x=4\\). As \\(x\\to 4^-\\), the denominator is negative and very small, so \\(f(x)\\to -\\infty\\). As \\(x\\to 4^+\\), the denominator is positive and very small, so \\(f(x)\\to +\\infty\\). Explain the difference between approaching a horizontal asymptote from above vs. approaching it from below. What does each imply about the sign of the derivative for large \\(x\\)? Suggested Answer Approaching from above means the function is decreasing toward the asymptote, so \\(f&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\) for large \\(x\\). Approaching from below means the function is increasing toward the asymptote, so \\(f&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) for large \\(x\\). A function has two vertical asymptotes at \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\). What does this imply about the domain and structure of the graph? Suggested Answer The domain excludes \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\). The graph is broken into three disconnected pieces, each with potentially different behavior (increasing/decreasing, concavity, extrema), since the function cannot cross those asymptotes. A rational function approaches the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\). Give a real-world environmental process that might behave this way. Suggested Answer Examples include pollutant concentration decaying toward zero, cooling curves approaching ambient temperature, radioactive decay processes, or stream velocity decreasing to near zero as flood waters recede.

First derivative (with factoring) Use the product rule: \\[ f&#39;(x) = (2x)e^{-x} + x^2(-e^{-x}) = e^{-x}(2x - x^2) = e^{-x}x(2 - x). \\] Critical points come from \\[ e^{-x}x(2-x)=0. \\] Since \\(e^{-x} \\neq 0\\), solutions are \\[ x=0,\\quad x=2. \\] Sign of \\(f&#39;(x)\\): For \\(x&lt;0\\): \\(x&lt;0\\), \\(2-x&gt;0\\) → negative → decreasing For \\(0&lt;x&lt;2\\): positive × positive → positive → increasing For \\(x&gt;2\\): positive × negative → negative → decreasing Thus: - Local minimum at \\(x=0\\) - Local maximum at \\(x=2\\) 2.

Second derivative (with factoring) Differentiate \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{2x}{x^2+1}. \\] Using quotient rule: \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{2(x^2+1) - 2x(2x)}{(x^2+1)^2} =\\frac{2 - 2x^2}{(x^2+1)^2} =\\frac{2(1-x^2)}{(x^2+1)^2}. \\] Solve \\[ 1 - x^2 = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x=\\pm 1. \\] Concavity: - For \\(|x|&lt;1\\): \\(1-x^2&gt;0\\) → concave up - For \\(|x|&gt;1\\): \\(1-x^2&lt;0\\) → concave down Thus \\(x=\\pm 1\\) are inflection points. Problem 6 — Rational Function With a Vertical Asymptote Consider the function \\[ f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 2}. \\] Use derivatives, sign charts, and asymptotes to analyze its behavior.

Full solution We analyze \\[ f(x)=\\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 2}. \\] 1. Domain and asymptote The denominator is zero at \\[ x = 2, \\] so the domain is all real numbers except \\(x=2\\). Thus there is a vertical asymptote at \\(x=2\\). 2. First derivative (with factoring) Quotient rule gives \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{x^2 - 4x + 1}{(x-2)^2}. \\] Critical points come from the numerator: \\[ x^2 - 4x + 1=0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}. \\] The derivative is undefined at the vertical asymptote \\(x=2\\). 3. Second derivative (with factoring) \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{6}{(x-2)^3}. \\] Sign analysis: For \\(x&lt;2\\): denominator \\(&lt;0\\) → \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&lt;0\\) → concave down For \\(x&gt;2\\): denominator \\(&gt;0\\) → \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) → concave up No inflection points occur within a domain interval — concavity only changes across the asymptote. 4. Behavior near the vertical asymptote To determine the direction of blow-up, compute limits from both sides. Left-hand limit (approach from below) As \\(x\\to 2^-\\): Numerator \\(x^2 - 1 \\to 3\\) (positive) Denominator \\(x - 2 \\to 0^-\\) (negative) Thus \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 2^-} f(x) = \\frac{3}{0^-} = -\\infty. \\] Right-hand limit (approach from above) As \\(x\\to 2^+\\): Numerator still \\(x^2 - 1 \\to 3\\) Denominator \\(x - 2 \\to 0^+\\) (positive) Thus \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 2^+} f(x) = \\frac{3}{0^+} = +\\infty. \\] 5. Summary of behavior Vertical asymptote at \\(x=2\\) \\(f(x)\\to -\\infty\\) as \\(x\\to 2^-\\) \\(f(x)\\to +\\infty\\) as \\(x\\to 2^+\\) Critical points at \\[ x=2-\\sqrt{3},\\quad x=2+\\sqrt{3}. \\] Concavity: Down on \\((-\\infty, 2)\\) Up on \\((2, \\infty)\\) Problem 7 — Rational Function With Two Vertical Asymptotes Consider the function \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{x(x-2)}. \\] Use derivatives, sign charts, and asymptotes to analyze its behavior. Check 1st derivative \\[ f&#39;(x)= -\\frac{2(x-1)}{x^2(x-2)^2}. \\] Check critical points \\[ x = 1. \\] Check 2nd derivative \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{2(3x^2 - 6x + 4)}{x^3 (x-2)^3}. \\] Check inflection points Solve \\[ 3x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0 \\] No REAL roots Full solution We analyze \\[ f(x)=\\frac{1}{x(x-2)}. \\] The denominator is zero at \\[ x = 0,\\qquad x = 2, \\] so these produce vertical asymptotes and the domain is \\[ (-\\infty,0)\\;\\cup\\;(0,2)\\;\\cup\\;(2,\\infty). \\] To compute the first derivative, rewrite the function as \\[ f(x)=[x(x-2)]^{-1}. \\] Differentiating gives \\[ f&#39;(x)=-(x(x-2))^{-2}(2x-2) =-\\frac{2(x-1)}{x^2(x-2)^2}. \\] Critical points come from the numerator: \\[ -2(x-1)=0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x=1. \\] The derivative is undefined at the vertical asymptotes. The second derivative is \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{2(3x^2 - 6x + 4)}{x^3 (x-2)^3}. \\] Second-derivative critical points solve \\[ 3x^2 - 6x + 4=0. \\] Using the quadratic formula, \\[ x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} =\\frac{6\\pm\\sqrt{36-48}}{6} =\\frac{6\\pm\\sqrt{-12}}{6}. \\] Because the discriminant is negative, the numerator never equals zero, so there are no real inflection points from the second derivative. Concavity changes only when crossing the asymptotes since the denominator changes sign there. To understand the behavior near \\(x=0\\): As \\(x\\to 0^-:\\) denominator \\(0^-\\cdot(-2)=0^+\\), so \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 0^-} f(x)=+\\infty. \\] As \\(x\\to 0^+:\\) denominator \\(0^+\\cdot(-2)=0^-\\), so \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(x)=-\\infty. \\] At \\(x=2\\): As \\(x\\to 2^-:\\) \\((2^-)(0^-)=0^{+}\\), so \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 2^-} f(x)=+\\infty. \\] As \\(x\\to 2^+:\\) \\((2^+)(0^+)=0^{+}\\), so \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 2^+} f(x)=+\\infty. \\] For the horizontal asymptotes, note that \\[ f(x)=\\frac1{x(x-2)}\\sim \\frac1{x^2} \\] as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\). Thus \\[ \\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty} f(x)=0, \\] so the horizontal asymptote is \\[ y=0. \\] In summary: Vertical asymptotes at \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=2\\). Horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\). One critical point from the first derivative at \\(x=1.\\) No real inflection points because the quadratic in the numerator of \\(f&#39;&#39;\\) has no real roots. Concavity changes only across asymptotes, due to the denominator’s sign. Problem 8 — Logistic-Style Function With Two Horizontal Asymptotes Consider the function \\[ f(x)=\\frac{80}{1+3e^{-0.5x}}. \\] Use derivatives and asymptotes to analyze its behavior. Check 1st derivative \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{120e^{-0.5x}}{(1+3e^{-0.5x})^2}. \\] Check critical points The derivative is always positive. \\[ \\text{No critical points (always increasing).} \\] Check 2nd derivative \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{60e^{-0.5x}(3e^{-0.5x}-1)}{(1+3e^{-0.5x})^3}. \\] Check inflection point Solve \\[ 3e^{-0.5x}-1=0. \\] \\[ e^{-0.5x}=\\tfrac13. \\] \\[ x = 2\\ln(3). \\] Check horizontal asymptotes \\[ \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)=0, \\qquad \\lim_{x\\to+\\infty} f(x)=80. \\] Horizontal asymptotes: \\[ y=0, \\qquad y=80. \\] Full solution We analyze \\[ f(x)=\\frac{80}{1+3e^{-0.5x}}. \\] Rewrite the function as \\[ f(x)=80(1+3e^{-0.5x})^{-1}. \\] Differentiate: \\[ f&#39;(x)=80(-1)(1+3e^{-0.5x})^{-2}\\cdot(3e^{-0.5x}\\cdot -0.5) =\\frac{120e^{-0.5x}}{(1+3e^{-0.5x})^2}. \\] Since all factors are positive, \\[ f&#39;(x) &gt; 0 \\] for every real \\(x\\). Thus the function is always increasing and has no local maxima or minima. Differentiate again: \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{60e^{-0.5x}(3e^{-0.5x}-1)}{(1+3e^{-0.5x})^3}. \\] Set the numerator equal to zero: \\[ 3e^{-0.5x}-1=0 \\] \\[ e^{-0.5x}=\\tfrac13 \\] \\[ x = 2\\ln(3). \\] For \\(e^{-0.5x} &gt; \\frac13\\), the graph is concave up; for \\(e^{-0.5x} &lt; \\frac13\\), the graph is concave down. As \\(x\\to -\\infty\\): \\(e^{-0.5x}\\to\\infty\\), denominator → ∞ \\[ f(x)\\to 0. \\] As \\(x\\to +\\infty\\): \\(e^{-0.5x}\\to 0\\), denominator → 1 \\[ f(x)\\to 80. \\] Thus the function is an increasing logistic curve with a lower horizontal asymptote at \\(y=0\\) and an upper horizontal asymptote at \\(y=80\\), switching concavity at the point \\(x = 2\\ln 3\\). Challenge 1 — Rational Function Consider the function \\[ f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2 + 1}. \\] Analyze the first derivative, second derivative, critical points, and inflection points. Check 1st derivative \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{4x}{(x^2+1)^2}. \\] Check critical points Critical points solve \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\): \\[ 4x = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = 0. \\] Check 2nd derivative \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x) = 4\\frac{1 - 3x^2}{(x^2+1)^3}. \\] Check inflection points Solve \\(1 - 3x^2 = 0\\): \\[ x = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}. \\] Full solution We analyze \\[ f(x)=\\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 2}. \\] 1. Domain and asymptote \\[ x - 2 = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = 2. \\] Thus the domain is \\[ (-\\infty,2)\\cup(2,\\infty), \\] with a vertical asymptote at \\(x=2\\). 2. First derivative (with factoring) Using the quotient rule: \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{(2x)(x-2) - (x^2 - 1)(1)}{(x-2)^2}. \\] Expand the numerator: \\[ 2x(x-2)=2x^2 - 4x, \\] Subtract the second term: \\[ 2x^2 - 4x - (x^2 - 1) = x^2 - 4x + 1. \\] So the derivative is \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{x^2 - 4x + 1}{(x-2)^2}. \\] How the critical points were found Critical points occur when the derivative equals zero and is defined. The denominator \\((x-2)^2\\) is never zero except at \\(x=2\\), where the function is undefined. So we only solve the numerator: \\[ x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0. \\] Apply the quadratic formula: \\[ x=\\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2} =\\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} =\\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2} =\\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{2} =2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}. \\] Thus the critical points are: \\[ x=2-\\sqrt{3},\\qquad x=2+\\sqrt{3}. \\] Because the derivative does not exist at \\(x=2\\), that point is not a critical point. 3. Second derivative We start with \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{x^2 - 4x + 1}{(x-2)^2}. \\] Using the quotient rule again: \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{6}{(x-2)^3}. \\] (Steps omitted here since they were checked previously.) Sign of \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\): For \\(x&lt;2\\): denominator negative → concave down For \\(x&gt;2\\): denominator positive → concave up Concavity switches across the vertical asymptote, not within the domain, so there are no inflection points. 4. Limits at the vertical asymptote Left-hand limit: \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 2^-} f(x) =\\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 2} =\\frac{3}{0^-} =-\\infty. \\] Right-hand limit: \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 2^+} f(x) =\\frac{3}{0^+} =+\\infty. \\] Thus: \\(f(x)\\to -\\infty\\) from the left of the asymptote \\(f(x)\\to +\\infty\\) from the right of the asymptote 5.

The equation sheet from the textbook is included as part of the test pack (it doesn’t count as note pages) Short-Answer Optimization Questions What is the “objective function” in an optimization problem? Solution It is the function you want to maximize or minimize—e.g., growth, cost, carbon storage, habitat value. Why is defining the objective function often the hardest step in real environmental problems? Solution Because you must decide exactly what you are optimizing and how competing processes (benefits vs. penalties, diminishing returns, constraints) interact mathematically. How do you find critical points of a differentiable function? Solution Differentiate the objective function and set the derivative equal to zero; solve for the variable(s). What does the second derivative tell you about a critical point? Solution If \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&gt;0\\): local minimum. If \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&lt;0\\): local maximum. If \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)=0\\): inconclusive. What should you do if the derivative never equals zero on the domain? Solution There are no interior critical points; the optimum must occur at a boundary or the function is monotonic. What if the derivative equals zero only at a point outside the feasible domain? Solution The critical point is thrown out. The optimum must lie at a domain boundary or another feasible critical point. What should you always check when a problem includes a constraint? Solution Check whether the unconstrained optimum is feasible. If not, the optimum lies on the boundary. Why do constrained optimization problems often require evaluating endpoints? Solution Because constraints restrict the domain; global optima often occur at boundaries, not at interior points. Why must you convert multivariable problems (with a constraint) into one variable before differentiating? Solution Because the variables are not independent; substituting the constraint ensures the derivative respects the relationship between variables. What does it mean if a critical point yields a negative value for a physical quantity (e.g., width, depth)? Solution It is physically impossible and must be rejected. Why can a function have a local maximum that is not the global maximum? Solution Local maxima only beat nearby values; global maxima require comparing all feasible values, including boundaries. Give one reason why the optimum might occur at the minimum allowed value of the variable. Solution If the objective decreases as the variable increases, the smallest allowed value gives the best outcome. Give one reason why the optimum might occur at the maximum allowed value. Solution If the objective increases with the variable and there is no interior critical point, the endpoint yields the maximum. A function is always increasing over the domain. Where is the maximum? Solution At the right endpoint. A function is always decreasing over the domain. Where is the minimum? Solution At the right endpoint (and maximum at the left endpoint). Why does concavity simplify optimization? Solution If concave down everywhere → any critical point is a global maximum. If concave up everywhere → any critical point is a global minimum. What should you do if the second derivative at a critical point is zero? Solution Use a first derivative sign chart, higher derivatives, or direct function comparison. The point may be max, min, or neither. Why must physical context be checked even after math gives a critical point? Solution Because the mathematically correct point may be unrealistic (negative depth, unsafe height, impossible density, etc.). How can you tell if the objective function incorrectly models the system? Solution If the model predicts impossible or nonsensical optimum values (infinite spacing, negative biomass), the formulation is wrong. What does it mean if two designs give nearly identical objective values? Solution The exact optimum may not matter; choose based on cost, practicality, or robustness. Sensitivity trumps precision. Why can a local maximum be ecologically meaningless? Solution If a larger feasible value exists elsewhere or if the local maximum lies in a biologically irrelevant part of the domain. In a constrained pond-design problem, why is the shallowest allowed depth sometimes optimal? Solution Because some models reward surface area more than depth, so minimum depth maximizes habitat or productivity. Why might an interior critical point be a minimum rather than a maximum? Solution Because the second derivative is positive (concave up). The global maximum might lie at a boundary. Why should you verify your derivative before solving the optimization problem? Solution A single differentiation error leads to entirely incorrect critical points and interpretations. What are the three steps for finding a global maximum on a closed interval? Solution Find interior critical points. Evaluate the objective at all critical points. Evaluate endpoints and compare all values. Practice: Optimization in Environmental Systems Work through the following 10 new problems to deepen your fluency with applied optimization, constraints, and interpretation. 1. Optimizing Leaf Nitrogen for Maximum Photosynthesis Leaf nitrogen concentration \\(N\\) strongly influences photosynthetic rate, but only up to a point. A simplified model: \\[ P(N) = 12N - N^2 \\] where: \\(N\\) = leaf nitrogen (% of dry mass) \\(P(N)\\) = relative photosynthetic rate Your Task Find the nitrogen level that maximizes photosynthesis. Confirm with the second derivative. Explain why both low and high nitrogen can be suboptimal. Show Solution Differentiate: \\[ P&#39;(N) = 12 - 2N. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 12 - 2N = 0 \\Rightarrow N = 6. \\] Second derivative: \\[ P&#39;&#39;(N) = -2 &lt; 0. \\] Thus \\(N = 6\\%\\) maximizes photosynthesis. Interpretation: Low nitrogen limits pigment formation; excess nitrogen leads to costly maintenance respiration. The model identifies the efficient “sweet spot.” 2. Designing a Riparian Buffer Strip for Maximum Nitrate Removal A riparian buffer is planted along a stream to reduce nutrient runoff. Nitrate removal per meter of stream is modeled as: \\[ R(w) = 20w - 0.4w^2 \\] where \\(w\\) = buffer width (m). Your Task Find width maximizing nitrate removal. Confirm it with the second derivative. Interpret ecologically. Show Solution \\[ R&#39;(w) = 20 - 0.8w. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 20 - 0.8w = 0 \\Rightarrow w = 25. \\] Second derivative: \\[ R&#39;&#39;(w) = -0.8 &lt; 0 \\Rightarrow \\text{maximum.} \\] Interpretation: Buffers too narrow miss pollutants; buffers too wide add little new plant/soil interface. Twenty-five meters maximizes filtration performance. 3. Optimizing Grazing Intensity for Meadow Restoration Meadow biomass under light grazing increases, but declines under heavy grazing. A restoration team models biomass as: \\[ B(g) = 80g - 5g^2, \\] where \\(g\\) is grazing intensity (sheep per hectare). Your Task Find the optimal grazing intensity. Confirm with the second derivative. Explain how this relates to “intermediate disturbance.” Show Solution \\[ B&#39;(g) = 80 - 10g. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 80 - 10g = 0 \\Rightarrow g = 8. \\] Second derivative: \\[ B&#39;&#39;(g) = -10 &lt; 0. \\] Interpretation: Very low grazing allows dominance by tall competitors; very high grazing suppresses all vegetation. An intermediate level (8 animals/ha) maximizes overall biomass. 4. Sizing a Biochar Kiln to Maximize Net Carbon Benefit A small biochar kiln processes biomass at rate: \\[ C(s) = 50s - 0.5s^2, \\] where \\(s\\) is kiln size (m³) and \\(C(s)\\) is net carbon benefit per batch. Your Task Find the optimal kiln size. Use second derivative to confirm. Explain why both too small and too large kilns are problematic. Show Solution \\[ C&#39;(s) = 50 - s. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 50 - s = 0 \\Rightarrow s = 50. \\] Second derivative: \\[ C&#39;&#39;(s) = -1 &lt; 0. \\] Interpretation: Small kilns underutilize heat; very large kilns lose heat to inefficiency and incomplete pyrolysis. A 50 m³ kiln balances throughput and efficiency. 5. Solar Farm Layout: Maximize Energy per Unit Land Area Panel spacing \\(d\\) affects shading and reflection losses. Energy per panel is modeled as: \\[ E(d) = 200d - 10d^2. \\] Your Task Find spacing that maximizes energy production. Check with second derivative. Explain physically. Show Solution \\[ E&#39;(d) = 200 - 20d. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 200 - 20d = 0 \\Rightarrow d = 10. \\] \\[ E&#39;&#39;(d) = -20 &lt; 0. \\] Interpretation: Panels too close shade each other; too far wastes land. Ten meters gives optimal solar spacing. 6. Terraced Hillside Farming: Minimizing Soil Loss A farmer designs terrace spacing \\(x\\) to minimize yearly soil loss: \\[ L(x) = \\frac{100}{x} + 0.5x, \\] where: \\(\\frac{100}{x}\\): erosion reduced by closer spacing \\(0.5x\\): cost of constructing/maintaining terraces Your Task Find \\(x\\) minimizing soil loss. Use the second derivative to confirm. Interpret tradeoffs. Show Solution \\[ L&#39;(x) = -\\frac{100}{x^2} + 0.5. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 0.5 = \\frac{100}{x^2} \\Rightarrow x^2 = 200 \\Rightarrow x = \\sqrt{200} \\approx 14.14. \\] Second derivative: \\[ L&#39;&#39;(x) = \\frac{200}{x^3} &gt; 0. \\] Thus \\(x \\approx 14.14\\) m minimizes soil loss. Interpretation: Tight spacing reduces erosion but is expensive; wide spacing saves cost but erodes more. The optimum balances erosion control and cost. 7. Designing a Wildlife Pond: Maximizing Habitat With a Volume Constraint Restoration ecologists are designing a circular wildlife pond to support amphibians, birds, and aquatic plants. Wide, shallow ponds offer the best habitat. Let: \\(r\\): pond radius (m) \\(h\\): pond depth (m) Volume requirement: \\[ \\pi r^2 h = 200. \\] Habitat quality: \\[ H(r,h) = \\pi r^2 - 4h. \\] Minimum ecological depth: \\[ h \\ge 0.5. \\] Show Solution Step 1: Express \\(H\\) in terms of \\(r\\) Use the volume constraint: \\[ h = \\frac{200}{\\pi r^2}. \\] Substitute into \\(H\\): \\[ H(r) = \\pi r^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{200}{\\pi r^2}\\right) = \\pi r^2 - \\frac{800}{\\pi r^2}. \\] Step 2: Differentiate Rewrite to differentiate cleanly: \\[ H(r) = \\pi r^2 - \\frac{800}{\\pi} r^{-2}. \\] Differentiate: \\[ H&#39;(r) = 2\\pi r + \\frac{1600}{\\pi r^3}. \\] Step 3: Look for critical points Set \\(H&#39;(r)=0\\): \\[ 2\\pi r + \\frac{1600}{\\pi r^3} = 0. \\] Both terms are positive for all \\(r&gt;0\\). Therefore, this equation has no solution. Conclusion: There is no interior critical point. Habitat quality increases as radius increases. Thus the maximum must occur on the boundary of the feasible region. Step 4: Apply the depth constraint Minimum allowable depth: \\[ h = 0.5. \\] Use the volume constraint to solve for \\(r\\): \\[ \\pi r^2 (0.5) = 200 \\] \\[ r^2 = \\frac{400}{\\pi} \\] \\[ r^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{400}{\\pi}} = \\frac{20}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\approx 11.28\\ \\text{m}. \\] Final Optimal Pond Design Optimal depth: \\[ h^* = 0.5\\ \\text{m} \\] Optimal radius: \\[ r^* \\approx 11.28\\ \\text{m} \\] Habitat Values for Different Depths Using the volume constraint \\[ r = \\sqrt{\\frac{200}{\\pi h}}, \\] we can compute the pond radius and the corresponding habitat value for several feasible depths. Depth \\(h\\) (m) Radius \\(r = \\sqrt{200/(\\pi h)}\\) (m) Habitat \\(H = \\pi r^2 - 4h\\) 0.5 11.28 398.0 1.0 7.98 196.0 2.0 5.64 92.0 3.0 4.61 54.67 4.0 3.99 34.0 Interpretation of the Table As depth increases, radius must decrease to keep volume fixed. Because habitat value heavily rewards surface area, habitat declines rapidly with increasing depth. The maximum habitat value occurs at the minimum feasible depth \\(h = 0.5\\), consistent with the analytic solution. Interpretation The model rewards surface area and penalizes depth, so making the pond as wide and shallow as allowed yields the highest habitat value. Without the minimum‐depth constraint, the model would push toward \\(r \\to \\infty,\\ h \\to 0\\). The ecological requirement \\(h \\ge 0.5\\) creates a realistic maximum. 8. Wind Turbine Height for Maximum Power Output A wind turbine’s power output depends on height \\(h\\) (meters): \\[ P(h) = 20h - 0.2h^2. \\] Your Task Find the optimal turbine height. Confirm with second derivative. Explain why turbines cannot just be infinitely tall. Show Solution \\[ P&#39;(h) = 20 - 0.4h. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 20 - 0.4h = 0 \\Rightarrow h = 50 \\text{ m}. \\] Second derivative: \\[ P&#39;&#39;(h) = -0.4 &lt; 0. \\] Interpretation: Height increases wind speed, but increased tower mass, bending stresses, and inefficiencies reduce marginal gains. Fifty meters is the balance point. 9. Coral Reef Restoration: Optimizing Transplant Density Transplanted coral fragments grow and fuse into colonies, but overcrowding increases mortality. Model: \\[ G(d) = 30d - d^2, \\] where \\(d\\) is transplant density (fragments per m²). Your Task Find density maximizing growth. Confirm with second derivative. Interpret. Show Solution \\[ G&#39;(d) = 30 - 2d. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 30 - 2d = 0 \\Rightarrow d = 15. \\] Second derivative: \\[ G&#39;&#39;(d) = -2 &lt; 0. \\] Interpretation: Low densities slow reef formation; high densities cause shading and disease. Fifteen fragments/m² is optimal. 10. Urban Green Roof: Minimizing Stormwater Runoff Green roof substrate depth \\(z\\) affects stormwater retention: \\[ R(z) = 15\\sqrt{z} - z. \\] Your Task Find depth maximizing retention. Use the second derivative test. Explain sustainability implications. Show Solution \\[ R&#39;(z) = \\frac{15}{2\\sqrt{z}} - 1. \\] Set to zero: \\[ \\frac{15}{2\\sqrt{z}} = 1 \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{z} = \\frac{15}{2} \\Rightarrow z = \\frac{225}{4} = 56.25. \\] Second derivative: \\[ R&#39;&#39;(z) = -\\frac{15}{4}z^{-3/2} &lt; 0. \\] Interpretation: Very shallow roofs store little water; very deep ones drain slowly and add weight. A depth of 56 cm balances retention and structural load. 11. Kelp Forest Restoration: Optimizing Mooring Spacing Kelp restoration teams anchor kelp seedlings on ropes suspended from floating buoys. If buoys are too close, shading reduces kelp growth; if too far, total canopy area decreases. Let spacing between buoys be \\(d\\) meters. Kelp canopy productivity per anchor rope is modeled as: \\[ P(d) = 80d - 4d^2. \\] Your Task Find the spacing \\(d\\) that maximizes kelp productivity. Confirm the result using the second derivative. Explain the ecological tradeoff shaping this optimum. Show Solution Differentiate: \\[ P&#39;(d) = 80 - 8d. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 80 - 8d = 0 \\Rightarrow d = 10. \\] Second derivative: \\[ P&#39;&#39;(d) = -8 &lt; 0, \\] so 10 m gives a maximum. Interpretation: Very tight spacing creates shading and drag; very wide spacing limits canopy formation. A 10-m spacing balances light availability with total canopy area. 12. Oyster Reef Design: Maximize Filtration Surface A reef restoration team designs reef modules of radius \\(r\\) (m). Surface area available for oyster attachment is: \\[ A(r) = 100r - 2r^2. \\] This captures: increasing habitat with module size, but diminishing efficiency as very large modules reduce water flow inside the reef. Your Task Find radius \\(r\\) maximizing oyster habitat area. Confirm with second derivative. Explain why very large modules reduce effectiveness. Show Solution Differentiate: \\[ A&#39;(r) = 100 - 4r. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 100 - 4r = 0 \\Rightarrow r = 25. \\] Second derivative: \\[ A&#39;&#39;(r) = -4 &lt; 0. \\] Thus the maximum occurs at 25 m. Interpretation: Large structures restrict internal circulation, reducing actual usable surface area. The optimum balances habitat size with efficient water flow. 13. Coral Nursery Lines: Optimizing Fragment Spacing Floating coral nurseries suspend corals along horizontal lines. Growth per coral fragment is modeled by: \\[ G(s) = 60s - 3s^2, \\] where \\(s\\) is spacing (cm). Your Task Find the spacing that maximizes coral growth. Use the second derivative test. Explain the biological reasoning behind the shape of the model. Show Solution Differentiate: \\[ G&#39;(s) = 60 - 6s. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 60 - 6s = 0 \\Rightarrow s = 10. \\] Second derivative: \\[ G&#39;&#39;(s) = -6 &lt; 0. \\] Thus coral growth is maximized at 10 cm spacing. Interpretation: Close spacing increases competition for light and water flow; wide spacing wastes nursery capacity. Ten centimeters provides an efficient density for fragment growth. 14. Hatchery Release Strategy: Optimal Smolt Size Fish survival after release increases with smolt size \\(m\\), but hatchery cost and predation during grow-out both increase with size. Survival benefit: \\[ S(m) = 200m - 5m^2. \\] First term: larger smolts survive ocean entry better Second term: diminishing returns and increased accumulation of hatchery cost/risk Your Task Find the size \\(m\\) (grams) maximizing survival benefit. Confirm with second derivative. Provide ecological interpretation. Show Solution Differentiate: \\[ S&#39;(m) = 200 - 10m. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 200 - 10m = 0 \\Rightarrow m = 20\\ \\text{g}. \\] Second derivative: \\[ S&#39;&#39;(m) = -10 &lt; 0. \\] Thus 20 g maximizes survival benefit. Interpretation: Fish released too small face marine predation; too large require costly rearing and encounter density-dependent issues in tanks. The optimum balances hatchery cost with early marine survival probability. Practice: Last year’s test questions Problem 1: Optimization — Stormwater Design A community center is installing a rectangular rain garden along the side of its building to capture and filter stormwater. The garden will be bordered by stone edging along two lengths and one width. The other width is against a wall and does not require edging. The stone edging costs $4 per meter, and the center has a total budget of $400. (a) Write an equation that relates the total cost of the edging to width \\(x\\) and length \\(y\\). (b) Use your equation to express the area \\(A(x) = xy\\) as a function of a single variable. (c) What dimensions will maximize the area of the rain garden within the budget? Click to show solution (a) Cost equation Edging is required along two lengths and one width, so the total edging length is \\[ 2y + x. \\] Edging costs $4 per meter and the budget is $400: \\[ 4(2y + x) = 400. \\] Divide both sides by 4: \\[ 2y + x = 100. \\] Solve for \\(y\\): \\[ y = \\frac{100 - x}{2}. \\] (b) Area as a function of one variable The area is \\(A(x) = xy\\). Substitute the expression for \\(y\\): \\[ A(x) = x\\left(\\frac{100 - x}{2}\\right) = 50x - \\frac12 x^2. \\] This is a downward-opening quadratic. (c) Dimensions that maximize the area First derivative: \\[ A&#39;(x) = 50 - x. \\] Set equal to zero to find the critical point: \\[ 50 - x = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = 50. \\] Second derivative: \\[ A&#39;&#39;(x) = -1, \\] which is negative, so the graph is concave down everywhere. Thus \\(x = 50\\) gives a maximum. Endpoint check Valid widths must satisfy \\(0 &lt; x &lt; 100\\). \\[ A(0) = 0, \\qquad A(100) = 0. \\] Interior value: \\[ A(50) = 50\\cdot 50 - \\frac12 (50)^2 = 1250. \\] The critical point has the largest area. Dimensions \\[ y = \\frac{100 - 50}{2} = 25. \\] Maximum-area garden: - Width \\(x = 50\\) m - Length \\(y = 25\\) m - Area \\(= 1250\\ \\text{m}^2\\) Problem 2: Optimization — Tree Spacing In a reforestation project, a conservation team is trying to determine the optimal spacing between rows of newly planted trees. If the spacing is too narrow, the forest becomes too dense for understory plants. If the spacing is too wide, there’s not enough shade to support sensitive species. The team models the biodiversity benefit by: \\[ B(w) = w^2 - 18w + 100 \\] where \\(w\\) is the width (in meters) between tree rows. To maintain accessibility and ecological integrity, spacing must be between 4 and 10 meters. (a) What spacing should the team choose to maximize biodiversity benefit? Click to show solution Objective The biodiversity benefit is modeled by: \\[ B(w) = w^2 - 18w + 100. \\] Spacing must satisfy: \\[ 4 \\le w \\le 10. \\] The goal is to find the value of \\(w\\) in this interval that maximizes \\(B(w)\\). First derivative \\[ B&#39;(w) = 2w - 18. \\] Set the derivative equal to zero: \\[ 2w - 18 = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad w = 9. \\] This is the only critical point. Second derivative \\[ B&#39;&#39;(w) = 2. \\] Since \\(B&#39;&#39;(w)\\) is positive, the function is concave up, meaning the critical point \\(w = 9\\) is a minimum, not a maximum. So the maximum must occur at one of the endpoints. Endpoint check Evaluate the function at the boundaries of the allowed interval: \\[ B(4) = 4^2 - 18(4) + 100 = 16 - 72 + 100 = 44, \\] \\[ B(10) = 10^2 - 18(10) + 100 = 100 - 180 + 100 = 20. \\] Compare with the interior value: \\[ B(9) = 9^2 - 18(9) + 100 = 81 - 162 + 100 = 19. \\] Conclusion The largest value is: \\[ B(4) = 44. \\] The spacing that maximizes biodiversity benefit is \\[ \\boxed{w = 4\\ \\text{meters}}. \\] Problem 3: Optimization — Urban Tree Buffer Design A city is creating a tree-planted buffer strip along a major roadway to reduce noise, absorb rainfall, and improve air quality. The environmental benefit score is modeled by: \\[ E(w) = -\\frac13 w^3 \\;-\\; \\frac12 w^2 \\;+\\; 6w \\] where: \\(w\\) = width of the buffer (meters) \\(E(w)\\) = environmental benefit score (unitless) (a) What is the objective function in this problem? (b) What are the constraints (if any)? (c) Find the buffer width that maximizes environmental benefit. (d) If there were more than one critical point, explain how you would choose between them. Click to show solution (a) Objective function The goal is to maximize the environmental benefit score: \\[ E(w) = -\\frac13 w^3 - \\frac12 w^2 + 6w. \\] (b) Constraints No explicit real-world constraints are stated, so mathematically we assume: \\[ w &gt; 0. \\] If desired, the city could later impose practical limits (e.g., available land width), but none are required to solve the problem. (c) Maximize the environmental benefit First derivative: \\[ E&#39;(w) = -w^2 - w + 6. \\] Set equal to zero: \\[ -w^2 - w + 6 = 0. \\] Multiply by \\(-1\\): \\[ w^2 + w - 6 = 0. \\] Factor: \\[ (w + 3)(w - 2) = 0. \\] Critical points: \\[ w = -3,\\quad w = 2. \\] Since width must be positive, the only feasible candidate is: \\[ w = 2. \\] Second derivative test \\[ E&#39;&#39;(w) = -2w - 1. \\] Evaluate at \\(w = 2\\): \\[ E&#39;&#39;(2) = -5, \\] which is negative, so the function is concave down at this point. Thus \\(w = 2\\) gives a local maximum of the benefit score. Endpoint check (conceptual) Because the domain is \\(w &gt; 0\\) and the cubic term is negative, \\[ E(w) \\to -\\infty \\quad \\text{as } w \\to \\infty. \\] And at very small positive widths: \\[ E(w) \\approx 6w &gt; 0, \\] so the function increases from 0, reaches a maximum at \\(w = 2\\), and then decreases forever. Thus the only maximum is at \\(w = 2\\). (d) Choosing between multiple critical points If several critical points were feasible, we would: Check the second derivative at each one (concave down → local max). Evaluate the function at all candidates and compare values. Apply domain constraints (e.g., discard negative or non-physical widths). If the domain were closed, also check endpoints. This ensures we select the point with the largest environmental benefit within all constraints. Final result The environmental benefit is maximized at: \\[ \\boxed{w = 2\\ \\text{meters}}. \\] Problem 4: Optimization — Compost Bin Design A community garden is building a square base open-top compost bin. The bin must have volume of 2.0 m³. The base costs $30 per square meter, and the sides cost $20 per square meter. Let: \\(l\\) = side length of the square base (meters) \\(h\\) = height of the bin (meters) (a) Write an equation for the cost in terms of the bin dimensions. What is the objective function? (b) What is the constraint equation? (c) Use the constraint to eliminate a variable and express the objective function in one variable. (d) Determine the optimal dimensions of the bin. Justify your reasoning. Click to show solution (a) Objective function: cost The bin has: A square base of area \\(l^2\\), costing $30 per m² Four sides, each of area \\(l \\cdot h\\), costing $20 per m² Total cost: \\[ C = 30l^2 + 4(20lh) \\] Simplify: \\[ C = 30l^2 + 80lh. \\] This is the objective function to minimize. (b) Constraint equation (volume) \\[ l^2 h = 2. \\] Solve for \\(h\\): \\[ h = \\frac{2}{l^2}. \\] (c) Eliminate a variable Substitute into the cost equation: \\[ C(l) = 30l^2 + 80l\\left(\\frac{2}{l^2}\\right) = 30l^2 + \\frac{160}{l}. \\] This expresses cost in terms of a single variable. (d) Find the optimal dimensions First derivative: \\[ C&#39;(l) = 60l - \\frac{160}{l^2}. \\] Set to zero: \\[ 60l = \\frac{160}{l^2} \\] \\[ 60l^3 = 160 \\] \\[ l^3 = \\frac{8}{3} \\] \\[ l = \\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right)^{1/3}. \\] Second derivative test \\[ C&#39;&#39;(l) = 60 + \\frac{320}{l^3}. \\] This is positive for all \\(l&gt;0\\), so the critical point is a minimum. Height calculation \\[ h = \\frac{2}{l^2}. \\] Using \\[ l = \\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right)^{1/3}, \\] we get the symbolic height: \\[ h = \\frac{3^{2/3}}{2}. \\] Numerical approximation: \\(3^{1/3} \\approx 1.44225\\) \\(3^{2/3} \\approx 2.08008\\) \\(h = \\frac{3^{2/3}}{2} \\approx \\frac{2.08008}{2} \\approx 1.04\\) So: \\[ h \\approx 1.04\\ \\text{m}. \\] Final optimal dimensions Side length: \\[ l = \\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx 1.39\\ \\text{m} \\] Height: \\[ h = \\frac{3^{2/3}}{2} \\approx 1.04\\ \\text{m} \\] These dimensions minimize construction cost while meeting the volume requirement.

Many of these resources give you the illusion of understanding - but the reality is quite different. 7.7.3 Late Assessment / Missed Assessment Policy This is a firm policy to make sure I am being fair to all of you. Grace period: Homeworks for this class are due Friday at 11:59pm. Homeworks will be accepted 72 hrs after their due date with no penalty (Monday 11:59pm). Graded work not turned in by this time will receive a grade of zero. Missed Tests: If you miss a test, you will need to use one of your ‘re-takes’ during finals weeks to do it. However, if you have a legitimate reason, I will work with you to reschedule the test earlier so you can save your re-take. Missed Class Preparation/Participation: From time to time we miss class for several reasons (studying for another test that day, field work, illness, etc). There will be no opportunity to submit preparation and participation activities if they are missed. The purpose of these activities are to reinforce concepts in the moment – and have little value out the context of the material being covered that day. To accommodate for this, 5% of the total preparation and participation assessments will be dropped. There will also be additional extra-credit opportunities throughout the term. Exceptional Circumstances: You must contact me 48 hours before the actual due date (not after the 48hr grace period) of a graded assignment to give me advanced notice, or within 12 hours after the work is due in the case of an emergency. If you fail to do this, you will receive zero credit for the missed assignment. Class Discussion What do we consider exceptional circumstances? 7.7.4 Test Retakes Policy There is no Final in this class – BUT – I will use the finals timeslot for the retakes. So don’t plan an early break if you think you might be doing a retake. If you miss a test during the term for a valid reason (health, emergency etc) and inform me in a timely manner, I’ll schedule a time during office hours for you to take the test. This flexibility is only good for a couple of days as I want to get the graded tests back to the rest of the class. If you miss a test for another reason (slept in, went to a wedding etc) you can always use one of your retakes – that’s what they are for. Reasons to retake Missed a test Want to try for a better grade Love calc so much you want to do more problems You can retake upto 2 tests. Your best score counts – so no risk 7.7.5 Office Hours Please select ALL times that could work. I will always try to hang around for 30mins or so after class to answer any questions. Office hours will be posted on Canvas as soon as they are set. 7.7.6 Class notes All notes that I take in class are available on the onenote notebook link on Canvas All lectures will be recorded - these will also be made available on Canvas From time to time the technology will fail us. Remember these are being provided as a bonus. There is no substitute for attending class and taking your own notes. 7.8 Questions? Class discussion Ask me anything - whats on your mind - need clarification on any of the things we’ve talked about? 7.9 Paper Planes Paper Plane Activity We are going to make paper planes and then see how well they fly. We are going to break into 4 groups: Group 1: Instructions not included – I know how to make a paper plane already Group 2: Notes - Watch the video multiple times, pausing and taking notes – I’m confident I can make a good plane Group 3: Team – Work together and make 1 TEAM plane. Group 4: Solo first + then team up - Make your own plane, then make a team plane Discussion Why did we make paper planes in calc? 7.10 Rate of Change - A First Look Class Discussion When we try to understand derivatives, the most common place to start is Position-&gt;Velocity-&gt;Acceleration and how they are linked. Lets have a look at this while watching Usain Bolt run the 100m in 9.69s While we watch this video I want you to keep in mind the idea of change - what variables are changing as we move through this race. Usain Bolt 100m Record Group Discussion How fast did he run? Can you calculate it? What was the fastest he ran? OR what was his top speed (velocity)? When do you think this happened? 3)The time it took him to get to 10m markers was measured, and the plot is below. What does this tell us about how fast he ran? 4)If we fit a smooth curve to this path, instead of looking at the slope over every 10m, we can look at the instantaneous rate of change or the derivative at any point. Note: The reason the curve needs to be smooth will be covered later - this is all just a preview No if we calculate the instantaneous rate of change and plot it against time - we get the velocity vs time relationship. Using this - try to describe how is velocity (speed) varied during the race. The world wondered how fast he could actually run the 100m. A year later at the world championships sensors were places along the tract to capture in high resolution his position with time. What do you notice this time? What is causing the oscillating in the red line?

Track units through computations and check results for reasonableness. Build and evaluate a simple model for an environmental variable as a function of time and elevation. It may have been a while since you last used some of your pre-calculus knowledge. Don’t worry if certain topics feel unfamiliar—we’ll walk through each concept with context and practice. This chapter is designed to help you review and refresh the foundational math skills that will support your success in this course. Think of it as a toolbox: later chapters will point to specific tools you’ll need to solve real problems, and those are the ideal moments to revisit them. Concepts stick best when learned in context—so come back to this chapter anytime you need a quick refresher. 8.1.1 ✏️ Reflection Prompt Which of these objectives feels most familiar to you? Which one do you think will be the biggest challenge? 8.2 Notes: 8.3 What You’re Expected to Know To get the most out of this course, you should feel reasonably comfortable with: Working with functions and interpreting graphs Manipulating algebraic equations Rules for exponents and logarithms Understanding and converting units Reading and setting up word problems If these topics feel rusty, that’s perfectly normal.

Put a star next to the ones you’d like extra practice with. Notes: 8.4 How to Approach Calculus Problems Calculus is about making sense of change. Use these steps as a guide when solving problems. 8.4.1 Analogy Prompt:Planning a Hike Think about the the process of planning a hike What decisions do you make to undertake this task? How do you weigh different factors? What “tools” do you already have that help you make choices? How might this be similar to the way we’ll approach calculus problems? Notes: 8.4.2 Clarify the Ask Prompt: What are we trying to answer - define the questions in your own terms. Notes: 8.4.3 List the Givens Prompt: List the variables, units, and known values. Make a quick sketch if it helps. Notes: 8.4.4 Translate the Math Prompt: Can you think of an equation that might be helpful for this problem? Think about what each term means in your own words? Notes: 8.4.5 Work Step by Step Practice: Solve the simple problem, but explain each step: What did you do? Why? What does the result mean? Then think about complexity: What assumptions did I make that weren’t realistic Notes: 8.4.6 Reflect and Interpret Prompt: Does your result make sense? Are the units correct? Is the magnitude reasonable? What does it say about the system? Notes: 8.4.7 Growth Mindset Reflection: What’s one strategy you’ll try when you get stuck? Write it here as a reminder. Notes: 8.5 How We Communicate Relationships Functions describe how one quantity depends on another. We can show this relationship in different ways: Words Graphs Tables Equations Each representation tells the story differently. Some make patterns clear, others make calculations easy. 8.5.1 Your Turn Practice: Describe how the air temperature has changed in the last 24 hours. Try using each representation: Write a short statement in words. Sketch or imagine a graph. Create a small table of values. Suggest a simple equation. Then reflect: - What are the pros/cons of each method? - What do you gain or lose when switching representations? Notes: 8.5.2 Discussion Prompt Practice: Air temperature usually drops as you climb a mountain (the “lapse rate”). How would you represent this relationship in words, graphs, tables, and equations? If the lapse rate is about 6.5 °C per 1000 m, what temperature do you predict at Mount Rainier’s summit (4392 m) if it’s 18 °C at sea level? What does the slope of your function represent? Notes: 8.6 Functions and Their Representations Functions are input–output machines: you put something in, apply a rule, and get something out. They can be written in many forms, but always represent a relationship. 8.6.1 Understanding \\(f(x)\\) Practice: What does \\(f(x)\\) mean in your own words? Identify the input, the rule, and the output in a function. Give one real-world example of a function you’ve seen. Notes: 8.6.2 Meaningful Names Practice: Lets look at two functions: a generic function like \\(f(x) = 0.2x + 3\\) \\(T(d) = 0.2d +3\\) where d is distance from the shore and T is the land temperature What are the differences between these two functions? How does changing the variable names affect interpretation? How does changing the variable names change the results? Notes: 8.6.3 Multiple Inputs Practice: Think of an environmental process that depends on more than one variable. Write a function with two inputs (e.g., \\(T(t,h)\\) for temperature as a function of time and elevation). What do each of the variables and parameters represent? Which variables might you ignore to keep the model simple? Notes: 8.6.4 Activity: Growth of a Tree Prompt: In a group, discuss the factors that control the growth of a tree. Write a pseudo-equation in the form \\[\\text{Growth} = f(\\text{Variable 1}, \\text{Variable 2}, \\ldots) \\] How many variables drive tree growth? Which ones would you include first in a simple model? Notes: 8.6.5 Activity: Modeling Temperature Practice: We can model temperature as a function of time and elevation: Start with a daily cycle at sea level. Adjust with the lapse rate (–6.5 °C per 1000 m). Combine them into \\(T(t,h)\\). Reflect: At what time of day is the difference between sea level and 2000 m greatest? What happens to the daily temperature range as elevation increases? Which variable (time or elevation) has the stronger effect in your model? Notes: 8.6.6 Activity: Telling the Story of a Complex Equation Practice: Consider the following model for photosynthesis in a plant canopy: \\[ A(t, I, T) = A_{\\max} \\cdot \\frac{I}{I + K} \\cdot e^{-0.01(T - 25)^2} \\cdot (1 - e^{-0.1t}) \\] Where: - \\(A(t, I, T)\\) = photosynthesis rate (µmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹) - \\(A_{\\max}\\) = maximum photosynthesis capacity - \\(I\\) = light intensity (µmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹) - \\(K\\) = half-saturation constant for light - \\(T\\) = temperature (°C) - \\(t\\) = time since sunrise (hours) Prompt: Tell the story of this equation in plain language. How does each factor (light, temperature, time) influence photosynthesis? Which parts of the equation act like limits or controls? What would happen if one variable stayed constant while the others changed? Notes: Seeing math as a complex story rather than symbols is a key to building mathematical literacy 8.7 Graphing and Interpreting Change 8.7.1 Key Ideas to Explore When is a function increasing or decreasing? Where are the peaks and valleys? How does the graph bend (concavity)? How do these patterns connect to environmental systems? 8.7.2 Practice Reading a Graph Activity: Look at a graph of a quadratic function (or sketch one). Figure 8.1: Quadratic function for practice: Where is it increasing or decreasing? Where is it increasing? Where is it decreasing? How do you know when the slope is positive, zero, or negative? What real-world system might this graph represent? Notes: 8.7.3 The Ball Analogy Discussion Prompt: Imagine throwing a ball straight up in the air. Figure 8.2: Empty axes for sketching height vs. time. Try to sketch the vertical position of the ball through time. When is it rising? When is it at its peak? When is it falling? How does the slope of the height vs. time graph change throughout? Notes: 8.7.4 Cubic Example Practice: Consider the function \\(f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2\\). Figure 8.3: Cubic function example with turning points. Where is the function increasing? Where is it decreasing? Where does it reach local maxima and minima? How does the concavity change (curving up vs curving down)? What real-world process might this model - can you tell a story? Notes: 8.7.5 Connecting Math to Environment Practice: Sketch or imagine a graph for each of these: A river’s flow during a flood event The daily temperature cycle (morning to night) The growth of algae in a lake after a nutrient spill For each: Where is it increasing/decreasing? Where would you expect peaks or valleys? How does concavity help tell the story? Notes: 8.8 Key Function Types Here are some of the most common function types you’ll see in environmental systems: Function Type Form Example Linear \\(y = mx + b\\) Streamflow increasing steadily over time Quadratic \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) Pollution dispersal from a point source Exponential \\(y = a \\cdot b^x\\) Invasive species population growth Logarithmic \\(y = \\log(x)\\) pH scale or sound intensity 8.8.1 Explore the Shapes Practice: Sketch the graphs of linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Figure 8.4: Clean blank axes without labels for sketching. How do they look different? Which ones keep increasing forever? Which ones turn around? What about curvature? Notes: 8.8.2 Match Functions to Situations Activity: Match each situation to a function type: Forest biomass after a fire The concentration of a chemical spill as you move downstream. A sea level over time. Notes: 8.8.3 Extend to Your Own Examples Discussion Prompt: Think of two environmental processes you know about (from ecology, hydrology, climate, etc.). Which function type might describe each process? What clues in the process tell you that? What would you expect the graph to look like? Notes: 8.9 Units, Rates, and Word Problems Units tell the story of your math. They help you avoid mistakes, interpret results, and check reasonableness. 8.9.1 Why Units Matter Practice: Consider the formula for streamflow: \\[ Q = A \\cdot v \\] Where: - \\(Q\\) = streamflow - \\(A\\) = cross-sectional area - \\(v\\) = velocity ) Write typical units for each of the variables. Do the units on both sides of the equation match? If not, what needs to change?

How can you interpret a derivative from a graph, dataset, or equation? What does derivative notation mean, and how does it connect to context? How could you apply derivatives to a real-world environmental example? Notes: 9.2 Understanding the Speed of Change A derivative is about how fast something is changing, right now, and in what direction. 9.2.1 Class Brainstorm: What’s Changing? Activity: Shared Google Doc As a group, pick an environmental system you are interested in (e.g. Lake Washington). Discuss: What quantity is changing in that system? What is it changing with respect to (time, distance, depth, etc.)? Why might the speed of change matter for scientists, managers, or communities? Rinse and repeat, can you think of another quantity or variable that is changing in your system? Share your group’s example with the class. Notes: 9.2.2 Average vs Right-Now: Build the Contrast Practice: Using your scenario: What average rate of change could you compute between two times? What would the instantaneous rate tell you “right now”? How would the decisions based on these two rates differ?

Snapshot: “Sea level is currently 1.2 meters above the baseline.” Speed: “Sea level is rising at 4 mm per year.” Step 1: Snapshot vs. Speed What can the snapshot alone tell the city planners? What critical information is missing if they only have the snapshot? How does the speed of change alter the urgency of decisions? Step 2: Consequences of Missing Information If planners only use the snapshot, what mistakes could they make? If they only use the speed, what context would be missing? Why do they need both?

Step 4: Generalize Complete this sentence as a group: In environmental systems, a snapshot tells us ________, but the derivative tells us ________. Notes: 9.4 What Is A Derivative? You’ve probably seen derivatives before—even if you didn’t call them that. If you’ve ever looked at how fast something was growing, declining, or shifting in space or time, you’ve already been thinking about derivatives. Table 9.1: Terms Across Disciplines That Represent Derivatives Math…Physics…Data…Context Environmental…Applied…Context Rate of change Growth rate Slope of the tangent line Decay rate Instantaneous rate Reaction rate Velocity Flux Acceleration Turnover rate Gradient Loss rate / Gain rate Marginal change Change per unit time Slope at a point Response rate Rise over run Uptake rate Delta Y / Delta X First difference Mathematically, the derivative describes the instantaneous rate of change—the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a given point. 9.4.1 Derivative Notation: Speaking the Language of Change In calculus, there are several common notations used to represent the derivative—the instantaneous rate of change of a function. Understanding these notations is key to reading and writing mathematics fluently, especially when interpreting real-world problems in environmental science. 9.4.1.1 Common Derivative Notations Let’s say we have a function, we could right this as: \\[ f(x) = something\\ with\\ x&#39;s \\ in\\ it \\\\ y= something\\ with\\ x&#39;s \\ in\\ it \\] We can then write the notation of the derivative with respect to \\(x\\) in several ways, all of which mean exactly the same thing: Notation Spoken As Description \\(f&#39;(x)\\) “f prime of x” Most compact form; often used in textbooks \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) “dee y over dee x” Emphasizes that \\(y\\) is a function of \\(x\\); Leibniz notation \\(\\frac{d}{dx} f(x)\\) “dee by dee x of f of x” Shows that differentiation is an operation \\(D_x f(x)\\) “D sub x of f of x” Operator form used in some texts \\(y&#39;\\) “y prime” Used when \\(y = f(x)\\), common in applied settings Prime notation: e.g., \\(f&#39;(x)\\), \\(g&#39;(t)\\) Leibniz notation: e.g., \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\), \\(\\frac{d}{dt}\\) Operator notation: e.g., \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(f(x))\\), applying \\(\\frac{d}{dt}\\) to an expression 9.4.1.2 The Derivative as an Operator The notation \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\) is not just a symbol—it’s an operator. That means it acts on a function to produce another function: the derivative. Think of it this way: The symbol \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\) is a command: “Take the derivative of whatever comes after this with respect to \\(x\\).” So if you write: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(3x^2 + 2x\\right) \\] You are instructing the reader (or yourself!) to differentiate the expression \\(3x^2 + 2x\\) with respect to \\(x\\). The result: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(3x^2 + 2x\\right) = 6x + 2 \\] 9.4.2 Snapshots vs speed of change We’ve seen examples where snapshots (a single measurement) and speed (how fast something changes) both matter. The derivative is the mathematical tool that lets us capture that “speed of change” precisely. 9.4.3 Spot the Derivative in Disguise Activity (Pairs or Small Groups): Below are phrases from different fields. Circle or underline the ones that represent a rate of change — in other words, a derivative in disguise. A glacier loses 2 km² of area per year Dissolved oxygen drops by 1 mg/L per meter of depth Tree canopy cover increases by 5% per kilometer toward the city center The tide is rising at 5 cm per hour Soil carbon decreases by 0.3 g per kilogram of soil nitrogen Ocean salinity is 34 parts per million Ocean salinity increases by 0.2 ppt per 100 km toward the equator CO₂ levels are increasing by 2.5 ppm per year A lake is 12°C in July Mountain snowpack decreases by 10 cm per 100 m of elevation gain The pH of a stream is 6.5 The pH of a stream drops by 0.1 units per kilometer downstream of a mine Forest biomass is 400 tons of carbon per hectare Forest biomass has been increasing by 3 tons per hectare per year Wind speed increases by 0.5 m/s per 10 m of height Annual rainfall totals 1200 mm Rainfall intensity rises by 2 mm per minute during a storm Nitrogen leaching is 4 kg/ha Nitrogen leaching rises by 0.1 kg per mm of irrigation applied Discuss: - Which are true derivatives? - Which are just static descriptions or ratios? - How can you tell the difference? Notes: 9.4.4 Tell the Story of the Math Activity (Whole Class): Consider the formula: \\[ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\] What do the symbols mean in plain language? How does this formula connect to “rise over run” from algebra? How could you explain this to a high school student using a real-world environmental example? Notes: 9.4.5 Reflection Prompt: Complete this thought: A derivative is not just a formula — it’s a way of describing ________. Notes: 9.5 Average Rate of Change The average rate of change tells us how much something changes per unit of input (like time, distance, or depth) over a chosen interval. Mathematically, it’s the slope of a secant line connecting two points on a function. 9.5.1 Practice: Secant Slope on a Graph Activity (Individual or Pairs): Look at the quadratic function below. \\[f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 5\\] Pick two points on the curve. Estimate their coordinates. Use the formula below to compute the average rate of change. \\[\\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\\] What does the sign of your slope tell you about how the function is changing? Write a descriptive sentence about what your value represents Notes: 9.5.2 Practice: Environmental Table Activity (Small Groups): The table below shows the amount of carbon stored in forest soil over time. Year Carbon (kg/m²) 2000 4.1 2005 4.8 2010 5.0 Compute the average rate of change from 2000 to 2005. Compute the average rate of change from 2005 to 2010. Compute the average rate of change from 2000 to 2010. Write one or two sentences explaining what these numbers mean in the context of carbon storage. Notes: 9.5.3 Practice: Application to Sea Level Activity (Whole Class Discussion): Suppose sea level in a coastal region is modeled by \\[S(t) = 3.2t + 45\\] where \\(S(t)\\) is in millimeters and \\(t\\) is years since 2000. Calculate the average rate of change of \\(S(t)\\) from 2010 to 2020. State the units of your result. Interpret the meaning: what does this tell us about sea level trends? Is there a shortcut to finding the average rate of change? Visualize this function with a sketch, add in the secant line, what do you notice? Notes: Environmentla Application - A Visual View Discussion Questions Describe the Trend What does the plot tell you about how global sea level has changed since 1993? Is the trend linear, exponential, or something else? Estimate the Average Rate of Change Pick two points on the black line (e.g., between 1993 and 2025) to estimate: \\[ \\text{Average Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Change in Sea Level (mm)}}{\\text{Change in Time (years)}} \\] What units does your answer have? Interpret in Context What does your calculated rate tell you about sea level rise? Why is knowing the average rate important for cities, communities, and planners? Explore Acceleration Estimate the average rate of change over each 5-year interval below by reading approximate values from the graph. Use the formula: \\[ \\text{Avg. Rate} = \\frac{\\Delta \\text{Sea Level}}{\\Delta \\text{Time}} \\quad \\text{(in mm/year)} \\] Fill in the table: Time Interval Sea Level at Start (mm) Sea Level at End (mm) Avg. Rate (mm/year) 1995–2000 2000–2005 2005–2010 2010–2015 2015–2020 2020–2025 What do you notice about how the average rate changes over time? What does that suggest about the acceleration of sea level rise? Connect to Derivatives If this were a smooth function \\(S(t)\\) representing sea level at year \\(t\\), what would the derivative \\(S&#39;(t)\\) represent? What would a plot of the average rate of change look like? What would happen if we looked at the average rate of change over shorter and shorter periods? How would this chang the way a plot of the rate of change look like? Reflection Prompt Describe a situation in your area of interest (marine biology, forestry, climate science, etc.) where an average rate of change is used. What does it tell you, and what might it leave out? 9.6 Instantaneous Rate of Change The instantaneous rate of change tells us how fast something is changing at a specific moment. Unlike the average rate, which looks at an interval, the instantaneous rate captures the slope of the tangent line at a single point. This is the essence of a derivative. 9.6.1 Zooming In on Change Activity (Whole Class Demonstration): Look at the function below. As a class, discuss: What does the slope of the curve at 2010 represent? Imagine drawing a tangent line right at that point. How is this different from a secant line? How might the meaning of this slope change if this were a glacier, a population, or a pollutant concentration? Notes: 9.6.2 Tangent Hunt Activity (Pairs): On the curve below: Mark one point where the tangent slope is clearly positive. Mark one point where the tangent slope is clearly negative. Mark one point where the tangent slope is zero. When does the sign of the tangent slope change? Where is change happening the fastest? (positive and negative) Discuss: What does each slope mean in an environmental context (e.g., population peak, fastest growth, fastest decline)? Break up the function into regions and tell a story. Notes: Challenge: Can you sketch the derivative - dont worry about getting the right magnitudes, just the right shape. [Hint: start with some points you know for sure, then ask yourself as you move left to right what is happening to the slope] 9.6.3 Practice: Bear Growth Scenario Activity (Small Groups): Imagine tracking the weight of a bear throughout its life. Sketch or imagine the weight vs. age curve. Where is the slope (rate of change) steepest? Where does the slope flatten out? Could it ever become negative? Group Discussion: Why might wildlife managers care about whether the rate of weight gain is accelerating or decelerating? Notes: Now try sketching the derivative, or the rate of change of the bear’s weight. 9.6.4 From a’s and b’s to a’s and h’s Changing our frame of reference \\[ \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\] 9.6.5 Data to Derivative Activity (Hands-On, with Data Table): You measure dissolved oxygen in a lake for three consecutive days: Day DO (mg/L) 4.0 8.15 5.0 8.10 6.0 8.05 Estimate the instantaneous rate of change at Day 4, 5 and 6 using the formula: \\[f&#39;(a) \\approx \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}\\] with \\(h = 1\\). Interpret your result in context, including units. Was it possible to calculate the instantaneous rate of change at day 6? How would a higher-resolution dataset (more frequent measurements) improve your estimate? Notes: REMEMBER: We are just estimating here! If h is small enough its a good estimate, if h is big, well it becomes the ‘average’ rate of change. Discuss: Is this more of an average or instantaneous rate of change? 9.6.6 Instantaneous vs. Average Activity (Class Discussion): Compare these two statements: A glacier retreats 20 meters per year between 2000 and 2010. On January 1st 2005, the glacier front is moving backward at 3.5 meters per year. Which is an average rate? Which is instantaneous? What added information do you get (or can deduce) when you have both pieces of information? Why does the distinction matter for scientists, policymakers, or communities? Brainstorm 2–3 other examples where average vs. instantaneous rates tell very different stories. Notes: 9.7 The Limit Definition of a Derivative We don’t do many proofs in this class, but understanding the mathematical origins of the derivative really helps with interpretation. So we will work through this one together. 9.7.1 Deriving the Limit Definition with a Real Example — Seattle Daylight We’ll use a simple model of daylight hours in Seattle (approx. 47.6°N) to build the derivative from limits. A realistic sinusoidal model for daylight hours \\(D(t)\\) (in hours) on day \\(t\\) of the year is: \\[ D(t) \\;=\\; 12.25 \\;+\\; 3.75 \\,\\cos\\!\\Big(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{365}\\,(t - 172)\\Big) \\] Midline \\(\\approx 12.25\\) hours Amplitude \\(\\approx 3.75\\) hours Let’s first build an intuition for what daylight hours look like over a year in Seattle. Sketch what you think the curve looks like (peak near late June, minimum near late December), then compare to the model above. Annotate interesting points along this function. 9.7.2 Connect to the Question Activity (Think-Pair-Share): Lets pick a specific day \\(a=250\\) (day 250 ≈ early Sep). What does \\(D(a)\\) represent in words? If you only know \\(D(a)\\) and \\(D(a+h)\\), how would you estimate “how fast daylight is changing around day \\(a\\)” using the average rate of change? Why might we want the instantaneous rate of change instead? Notes: 9.7.3 From Average to Instant: The Difference Quotient Step 1 — Average Rate on \\([a, a+h]\\): Write the average rate of change of daylight hours between day \\(a\\) and day \\(a+h\\) where \\(h=10\\): Day of Year Daylight Hours (hrs) 250 13.26 260 12.61 270 11.96 \\[ \\frac{D(a+h) - D(a)}{h} \\] What does the numerator represent in context? What are the units of this average rate? Notes: Step 2 — Shrink the Interval: To get the rate “right now” on day \\(a\\), we take the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\): \\[ D&#39;(a) \\;=\\; \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{D(a+h) - D(a)}{h} \\] So if we use the data below we can see we are shrinking our \\(h\\) getting it close to \\(0\\). Day of Year Daylight Hours (hrs) 250 13.259 251 13.195 252 13.131 Calculate the average rate of change with an \\(h=1\\) What if we shrink the interval even further and make \\(h=0.01\\) Day of Year Daylight Hours (hrs) 250.00 13.259240 250.01 13.258602 250.02 13.257965 Why can’t we just set \\(h=0\\) directly? In words, what does this limit do with the two-day comparison? Notes: Challenge: In your groups discuss this table, what do you notice on both ends of the table? h Average Rate of Change (hrs/day) 365 0.000000 300 0.009487 200 -0.002907 100 -0.046478 50 -0.062121 10 -0.064676 1 -0.063844 0.1 -0.063732 0.01 -0.063721 0.001 -0.063720 0.00001 -0.063720 Technically what have found here is an estimate for the instantanous rate of change at a point 9.7.4 Visualizing Secant \\(\\to\\) Tangent (Seattle Daylight) Using the plot below, sketch: The secant at day 250 with \\(h=365\\) Now draw another secant with \\(h=300\\) Now draw it with \\(h=50\\) Finally sketch the tangent at \\(h=250\\) Remember the average rate of change equation is just rise over run or the slope of the secant lines, so the slopes of the lines are what tell us the rate of change 9.7.5 Read What the Slope Means Interpretation: Using your numerical/visual estimate of \\(D&#39;(a)\\): If \\(D&#39;(a) &gt; 0\\), what does that say about the season and daylight change? If \\(D&#39;(a) &lt; 0\\), what time of year might that correspond to? If \\(D&#39;(a) \\approx 0\\), what’s happening seasonally? Notes: 9.7.6 Why Limits Matter (Wrap-Up) Prompt: Explain—in your own words—why the limit is essential for defining the instantaneous rate of change, using the Seattle daylight model as your example. Notes: 9.8 Introducing Limit Notation We now need a way to formalize what happens as we “zoom in” on a function — this is where the idea of a limit comes in. 9.8.1 Building Intuition Activity (Think-Pair-Share): Imagine a pollutant concentration in a river, \\(C(x)\\), as you move downstream toward a factory outfall. At 0.9 km downstream, \\(C = 4.9\\) mg/L At 0.99 km, \\(C = 4.99\\) mg/L At 0.999 km, \\(C = 4.999\\) mg/L As you move closer to 1 km, what value does the concentration seem to be approaching? This “approaching behavior” is what we call the limit. Notes: 9.8.2 Symbol and Words Practice: The formal symbol is: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) \\] What does the arrow (\\(\\to\\)) mean? What does the \\(a\\) represent? What is \\(f(x)\\) approaching as \\(x\\) gets closer to \\(a\\)? Notes: 9.8.3 Why Not Just Plug In? Discussion Prompt: Sometimes \\(f(a)\\) is undefined (like dividing by zero). In fact - when we look at the limit defintion of a derivative, this is the problem we encounter. \\[ f&#39;(a) \\;=\\; \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Notes: 9.8.4 One-Sided Limits Activity (Small Groups): We can approach a point from the left (\\(a^-\\)) or from the right (\\(a^+\\)). Sketch a graph where the left-hand and right-hand limits are the same. Sketch a graph where they are different. Can you link this to a real-world example? Notes: 9.9 From Average to Instantaneous: The Role of Limits We want to connect the average rate of change to the instantaneous rate of change. Start with the average rate formula: \\[ \\text{Average Rate on } [a,b] = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \\] 9.9.1 Scaffold the Derivation Practice (Step by Step): Start with the formula for the average rate of change between two points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\): \\[ \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \\] What does the numerator mean? What does the denominator mean? Introduce a new variable \\(h = b-a\\). Rewrite the denominator in terms of \\(h\\). Replace \\(b\\) with \\(a+h\\). Show that the formula becomes: \\[ \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Why is this still the average rate of change, just written differently? Try to explain this with a sketch. Now imagine shrinking the interval smaller and smaller: let \\(h \\to 0\\). This makes the slope of secant line approach the slope of the tangent line. What problem happens if you just set \\(h=0\\)? How does the limit fix this? Add in the limit notation Arrive at the definition of the derivative: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Notes: Let’s annotate this equation so we know what everything is and what to do with it. \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] 9.10 Finding the Derivative Using the Limit Definition of a Derivative We’ll now practice moving from the definition of the derivative to actually computing one. Remember, the derivative at a point \\(a\\) is defined as: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] We are going to take this one step at a time: We’ll deal with the numerator We’ll add in the fraction term We’ll add the limit 9.10.1 Step 1: Setup the equations Activity: Suppose we have the function: \\[ f(x) = x^2 \\] We want to find the derivative at \\(x = 2\\). Write down the limit definition of the derivative at \\(a = 2\\). Substitute \\(a = 2\\) into the formula (but don’t simplify yet). What expression do you now have? Notes: 9.10.2 Step 2: Expand the Numerator Activity: The numerator is: \\[ f(2+h) - f(2) \\] Compute \\(f(2+h)\\). Compute \\(f(2)\\). Subtract them to simplify the numerator. Write your result in expanded form. Notes: 9.10.3 Step 3: Simplify the Difference Quotient Activity: Now substitute your numerator back into: \\[ \\frac{f(2+h) - f(2)}{h} \\] Factor/simplify if possible. What cancels out? Why is this helpful? Notes: 9.10.4 Step 4: Take the Limit Activity: Finally, take the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\). Substitute \\(h = 0\\) after simplification. What value do you get for \\(f&#39;(2)\\)? Interpret: What does this mean in terms of the slope of the tangent line? Notes: You’ve found the derivative at a point \\(a=2\\) 9.10.5 Step 5: Generalize Activity: Repeat the same process, but this time use \\(x\\) instead of a fixed number like 2. Start with: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\] Expand \\(f(x+h)\\) and subtract \\(f(x)\\). Simplify and take the limit. What is the general derivative function of \\(f(x) = x^2\\)? Notes: You’ve now found the derivative function 9.11 Workbook: More Practice with the Limit Definition Now let’s apply the same step-by-step process to two new functions. Work carefully through each scaffold — the algebra will get trickier, but the structure is the same. 9.11.1 Example 1: \\(f(x) = x^3\\) We’ll find the derivative of \\(f(x) = x^3\\) at a point, and then generalize. 9.11.1.1 Step 1: Write the Definition Activity: Start with the limit definition: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Substitute \\(f(x) = x^3\\). Don’t expand yet, just write down the expression. Notes: 9.11.1.2 Step 2: Expand Activity: - Expand \\((a+h)^3\\). - Subtract \\(a^3\\). - Simplify your numerator. Notes: 9.11.1.3 Step 3: Simplify the Fraction Activity: - Divide the numerator by \\(h\\). - Cancel common factors where possible. - What remains? Notes: 9.11.1.4 Step 4: Take the Limit Activity: - Let \\(h \\to 0\\). - What’s left? - Interpret: What does this slope mean for the cubic function at \\(x=a\\)? Notes: 9.11.2 Step 5: Generalize Activity: Repeat the same process, but this time use \\(x\\) instead of a fixed number \\(a\\). What is the derivative function? Notes: 9.11.3 Example 2: \\(f(x) = 3x^2 + 7x\\) This time, the function is a polynomial. Let’s find its derivative using the limit definition. 9.11.3.1 Step 1: Write the Definition Activity: - Start with: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Substitute \\(f(x) = 3x^2 + 7x\\). Notes: 9.11.3.2 Step 2: Expand Activity: - Expand \\(3(a+h)^2 + 7(a+h)\\). - Subtract \\((3a^2 + 7a)\\). - Simplify your numerator. Notes: 9.11.3.3 Step 3: Simplify the Fraction Activity: - Factor out \\(h\\) from the numerator. - Cancel the denominator. - What remains? Notes: 9.11.3.4 Step 4: Take the Limit Activity: - Let \\(h \\to 0\\). - State the result clearly as \\(f&#39;(x)\\). - Interpret: How do the terms \\(3x^2\\) and \\(7x\\) each behave under differentiation? Notes: 9.11.4 Step 5: Generalize Activity: Repeat the same process, but this time use \\(x\\) instead of a fixed number \\(a\\). What is the derivative function? Notes: 9.11.5 Example 3: Environmental Application — Glacier Retreat Suppose the area of a glacier (in km\\(^2\\)) is modeled by: \\[ G(t) = 100 - 2t - 0.1t^2 \\] where \\(t\\) is years since 2000. We want to compute the instantaneous rate of change of glacier area at \\(t = 10\\). Practice (Small Groups): 1. Write the limit definition for \\(G&#39;(10)\\). 2. Compute \\(G(10+h)\\). 3. Subtract \\(G(10)\\). 4. Divide by \\(h\\). 5. Simplify. 6. Take the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\). Discussion: - What does the sign of \\(G&#39;(10)\\) tell you about the glacier at that time? - How would you explain your result to a policymaker? Notes: Practice Given \\(f(x)=7x\\) Find an expression for the derivative function \\(f&#39;(x)\\), using the limit definition of the derivative.

Practice Given \\(f(x)=27\\) Find an expression for the derivative function \\(f&#39;(x)\\), using the limit definition of the derivative. Hard problem (because of the algebra) Given \\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}\\) Find an expression for the derivative function \\(f&#39;(x)\\), using the limit definition of the derivative. Estimate vs Calculate Given \\(f(x)=e^x\\) Estimate, using the limit definition of the derivative, \\(f&#39;(1)\\). 9.12 Workbook: When Does a Derivative Exist? 9.12.1 Exploring Differentiability, Continuity, and Smoothness Before we use derivatives, we need to know when they exist. In other words, under what conditions is a function differentiable at a point? 9.12.2 Requirements for Differentiability At a point \\(x = a\\), a function \\(f\\) is differentiable if its instantaneous rate of change (the derivative) exists and is finite. Formally: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} \\] exists and is a real number. For that limit to exist, three conditions must hold: Requirement Meaning What Can Go Wrong 1. Function is defined \\(f(a)\\) exists Hole, asymptote 2. Function is continuous \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a)\\) Jump or removable discontinuity 3. Slope changes smoothly The left- and right-hand difference quotients approach the same finite value Corner, cusp, vertical tangent, oscillation A function is differentiable if it is defined, continuous, and smooth (no sharp turns or infinite slopes). Prompt 1: Definition and Meaning In your own words, what does it mean for a function to be differentiable? How is this related to the idea of a function being continuous and smooth? Notes: 9.12.3 Continuity: The Foundation for Differentiability A function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at a point \\(x = a\\) if all three of the following conditions are satisfied: 1. The function is defined at \\(a\\) \\[ f(a) \\text{ exists.} \\] → In practice: Check that there’s a real number assigned to \\(f(a)\\); the point is not a hole, asymptote, or gap. Prompt 2: Sketch or describe an example of a function that is not defined at a point. What happens to continuity there? Notes: 2. The limit exists as \\(x \\to a\\) \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) \\text{ exists.} \\] → In practice: Approach \\(a\\) from both the left and right. If the left-hand and right-hand limits agree and are finite, the limit exists. Prompt 3: Give an example where the left-hand and right-hand limits are different. How does this affect continuity? Notes: 3. The limit equals the function value \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a) \\] → In practice: Compare the numerical (or graphical) limit you found with the actual value of \\(f(a)\\). If they match, the function is continuous at that point. Task A — Classify each panel (1–9): For each graph, decide whether the function is continuous within the region shown on the graph. If it is not continuous, label the failure type: Removable (hole / mismatched value) Jump Infinite (vertical asymptote) Oscillation (no limiting value) Task B — Multiple issues: Some panels show more than one issue in the same figure. List all points of discontinuity and classify each one. Task C — Continuous examples: Which panels are continuous as shown on their intervals? Explain briefly why. Suggested table (copy and fill): Panel Continuous? Discontinuity points Type(s) One-sentence reason 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Extension: For any discontinuity you labeled removable, propose a value for \\(f(a)\\) that would make the function continuous at that point, and justify it. Notes: Summary: A function is continuous at \\(x=a\\) if: 1. \\(f(a)\\) exists, 2. \\(\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)\\) exists, and 3. \\(\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = f(a)\\). 9.13 Smoothness: When Is a Function “Nice Enough” to Differentiate? Continuity alone is not enough for differentiability. A function can be continuous but still have sharp corners, cusps, or vertical tangents where the slope suddenly changes or becomes infinite. To take a derivative, the function must also be smooth — meaning its slope changes gradually. 9.13.1 What “Smoothness” Means A function \\(f(x)\\) is smooth at a point \\(x = a\\) if: It is continuous at \\(a\\). Its derivative exists and is finite at \\(a\\). The slope changes continuously (no sudden jumps or sharp turns). Prompt 5: What visual features in a graph help you decide whether a function is “smooth”? List or sketch examples of what fails to be smooth. Notes: 9.13.2 How to Test for Smoothness To check whether a function is smooth at \\(x = a\\): Confirm continuity: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a) \\] → The graph is unbroken at \\(a\\). Check the slopes from both sides: \\[ \\lim_{h \\to 0^-}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{h \\to 0^+}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\] → If both limits exist, are finite, and equal each other, the function is smooth at that point. Look for visual cues: A corner or cusp means slopes differ → not smooth. A vertical tangent means infinite slope → not smooth. A continuous curve with gentle slope change → smooth. Prompt 6: Identify which of the following functions are smooth at \\(x=0\\): Explain your reasoning. Notes: 9.13.3 Why Smoothness Matters Smoothness tells us that the system changes gradually, without abrupt shifts. In environmental modeling, this matters because: Temperature, population, or nutrient levels that change smoothly can be modeled with differential equations. Processes with jumps or discontinuities (like dam releases or landslides) require piecewise or non-differentiable models. 9.13.4 Examples Function Smooth? Why \\(f(x) = x^2\\) ✅ Yes Continuous and derivative exists everywhere \\(f(x) = |x|\\) ❌ No Corner at \\(x=0\\) — left and right slopes differ \\(f(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x}\\) ❌ No Vertical tangent at \\(x=0\\) (infinite slope) \\(f(x) = x\\sin(1/x)\\) (define \\(f(0)=0\\)) ❌ No Oscillating slope near \\(x=0\\) \\(f(x) = e^{-x^2}\\) ✅ Yes Infinitely smooth everywhere 9.14 Testing for Differentiability To test whether \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(x=a\\): Check definition: Make sure \\(f(a)\\) exists. → If not, derivative automatically fails. Check continuity: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a) \\] → If there’s a jump or hole, \\(f&#39;(a)\\) cannot exist. Compare slopes from both sides: \\[ \\lim_{h \\to 0^-}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{h \\to 0^+}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\] → If they’re equal and finite, \\(f&#39;(a)\\) exists. → If they differ or blow up, \\(f&#39;(a)\\) does not exist. Key relationship: If \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\), then \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(a\\). However, the converse is not always true — \\(\\text{continuous} \\not\\Rightarrow \\text{differentiable}.\\) Prompt 7: Sketch or describe a function that is continuous but not differentiable. What feature prevents the derivative from existing? Notes: 9.15 Common Ways Differentiability Fails Type of Failure Description Example Discontinuity Jump or hole at the point Step in dam outlet temperature Corner or cusp Left and right slopes differ \\(f(x) = |x|\\) at \\(x=0\\) Vertical tangent Slope tends to \\(\\pm\\infty\\) \\(f(x) = (x)^{1/3}\\) at \\(x=0\\) Oscillating slope No single limiting slope \\(f(x) = x \\sin(1/x)\\) at \\(x=0\\) Checking Differentiability at \\(x=0\\) In each panel below, decide whether the function is differentiable at \\(x=0\\). Use the following criteria to test: 1. Is the function defined at \\(x=0\\)? 2. Is the function continuous at \\(x=0\\)? 3. Do the left-hand and right-hand slopes (derivatives) agree and are they finite? Panel Function Defined at \\(x=0\\)? Continuous at \\(x=0\\)? Left &amp; Right Slopes Equal &amp; Finite? Differentiable? 1 \\(f(x)=e^{-x^2}\\) 2 \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{|x|}\\) 3 \\(f(x)=x+|x|\\) 4 \\(f(x)=\\sin(x^2)\\) 9.16 Environmental Examples Scenario What’s Happening Differentiability Outcome Dam outlet temperature step Sudden jump between upstream and downstream water Derivative does not exist (discontinuous) Piecewise linear rating curve Continuous but with a sharp corner Derivative does not exist at the corner Sharp flood peak Slope becomes extremely steep Derivative may tend to \\(\\infty\\), so does not exist Smooth glacier retreat curve Continuous and smooth change in slope Differentiable 9.17 Activity: From Function to Derivative Graphs In each question below, you are shown a graph of a function \\(f(x)\\). On the blank axes provided, sketch the derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\). Focus on identifying: where the slope is positive, negative, or zero, relative steepness (large vs. small magnitude), points of non-differentiability or smooth transitions. Recipe of Plotting Derivatives What are we actually plotting? What are the key steps? What are the checks? More Limit Definition Practice Given the quadratic equation: \\(f(x) = 3x^2 + x\\). Find the derivative function using the limit definition of the derivative What is the derivative at x=0, \\(f&#39;x(0)\\)? What does the mean graphically? Can you find the equation for the tangent line at x=0? These equations might help with thinking about the equation of the tangent. \\[ y - f(a) = f&#39;(a)\\,(x - a) \\] \\[ y = mx+b \\] Testing a Limit Consider the function: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 1}{x - 1} \\] Find the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x \\to 2\\). \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 2} \\frac{x^2 + 1}{x - 1} \\] Find the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x \\to 1\\). \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 + 1}{x - 1} \\] Is this function differentiable everywhere?

Apply basic rules — constant, power, constant multiple, sum/difference, \\(e^x\\), \\(\\ln x\\), \\(\\sin x\\), \\(\\cos x\\) — to differentiate common terms without reverting to limits. Use the product, quotient, and chain rules to differentiate functions built from multiple changing parts, showing clear intermediate steps and correct notation. Select the right rule(s) for a given function by identifying its top-level structure and any nested “inside–outside” relationships. Interpret derivatives in context, explaining what a computed rate of change means for an environmental quantity (e.g., pollutant concentration, biomass, streamflow). Check and simplify results, factoring, combining like terms, and performing quick reasonableness checks (units, signs, limiting behavior). Communicate with multiple notations — prime, Leibniz, and operator — and translate between them accurately. Diagnose common errors, such as forgetting the inner derivative or misusing product vs. chain rule, and correct them using structured reasoning or unit checks. Success looks like: Given a new environmental model, you can: Identify which derivative rules apply, Compute \\(f&#39;(x)\\) cleanly, and Explain in words what that derivative tells you about how the system is changing. 10.2 Activity: Reading Math as Instructions — The Derivative of a Constant Not all functions change. A constant function is perfectly flat — no growth, no decline, no change over time or space. The derivative gives us a way to prove that this lack of change equals a slope of zero. 10.2.1 Step 1: Read the Expression Aloud Prompt: Read this equation aloud and explain what each part is telling you to do: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}(c) = 0 \\] Symbol / Term What It Tells You To Do \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\) \\(c\\) \\(= 0\\) Notes: 10.2.2 Step 2: Translate to a Step-by-Step Recipe Activity: In your own words, describe what the rule for a constant tells you to do. Recognize that the function’s value never changes — it’s constant for all \\(x\\). The “rate of change” or “slope” is therefore zero everywhere. When you apply the derivative operator \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\), the output is \\(0\\). Now apply this to three examples: Function \\(f(x)\\) What It Represents Derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\) \\(f(x) = 7\\) Constant value \\(f(x) = -12\\) Constant offset \\(f(x) = 3.14\\) Physical constant Notes: 10.2.3 Step 3: Deriving the Rule from the Limit Definition We can confirm this result directly from the limit definition of a derivative: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\] If \\(f(x) = c\\) (a constant), then: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{c - c}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{0}{h} = 0 \\] Because the numerator is always zero, the slope — the rate of change — is zero everywhere. In words: “When nothing changes, the rate of change is zero.” 10.2.4 Step 4: Apply to Environmental Contexts Practice: For each situation, identify whether the derivative (rate of change) would be zero or nonzero. Scenario Description Is the Derivative Zero? Why? A lake’s surface area remains 10 km² for 10 years Atmospheric CO₂ remains steady at 420 ppm for one month Soil temperature remains constant throughout the day Now write one more realistic example where a quantity stays constant in your field (e.g., hydrology, forestry, marine science). Notes: 10.2.5 Step 5: Reflect — Flatness as Zero Change Reflection Prompt: Complete this thought: “When I see \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(c) = 0\\), I think of it as a statement that ________.” Notes: 10.3 Activity: Reading Math as Instructions — The Power Rule Mathematics is a language of instructions. When you see a formula like the Power Rule, you’re not just seeing symbols — you’re seeing a procedure that tells you what to do and how each step transforms the function. 10.3.1 Step 1: Read the Expression Aloud Prompt: Read this equation aloud and explain what each part is asking you to do: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\big(x^n\\big) = n x^{n-1} \\] Symbol / Term What It Tells You To Do \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\) \\(x^n\\) \\(n\\) \\(x^{n-1}\\) Notes: 10.3.2 Step 2: Translate to a Step-by-Step Recipe Activity (Think–Pair–Share): In your own words, write the recipe the Power Rule gives you for differentiating \\(x^n\\): Look at the exponent \\(n\\). Multiply the whole expression by that exponent. Subtract one from the exponent. Keep the base \\(x\\) the same. Now apply this recipe to three quick examples: Function \\(f(x)\\) Your Steps Derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\) \\(x^2\\) \\(x^5\\) \\(x^{-3}\\) Notes: 10.3.3 Step 3: Deriving the Power Rule from the Limit Definition Let’s see how the Power Rule comes directly from the limit definition of a derivative. We start with: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(x+h)^n - x^n}{h} \\] We expand \\((x+h)^n\\) using the Binomial Theorem: \\[ (x + h)^n = x^n + n x^{n-1}h + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^{n-2}h^2 + \\cdots + h^n \\] Substitute this expansion into the limit expression: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\big(x^n + n x^{n-1}h + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^{n-2}h^2 + \\cdots + h^n\\big) - x^n}{h} \\] Simplify the numerator — the \\(x^n\\) terms cancel: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{n x^{n-1}h + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^{n-2}h^2 + \\cdots + h^n}{h} \\] Now factor out \\(h\\): \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\Big( n x^{n-1} + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^{n-2}h + \\cdots + h^{n-1} \\Big) \\] As \\(h \\to 0\\), all terms containing \\(h\\) vanish, leaving only: \\[ \\boxed{f&#39;(x) = n x^{n-1}} \\] That’s the Power Rule — it’s the simplified result of the limit definition. 10.3.4 Step 4: Apply the Instructions to a Real Example Practice: Let \\(f(x) = x^4\\). Identify the base and exponent. Apply the Power Rule as a set of instructions. Simplify your result. Interpret your answer: what does \\(f&#39;(x)\\) mean if \\(f(x)\\) represents biomass growth rate over time? Notes: 10.3.5 Step 5: Reflect — Reading vs. Memorizing Reflection Prompt: Complete this thought: “When I see \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = n x^{n-1}\\), I now think of it as a set of instructions to ________.” Notes: 10.4 Activity: Reading Math as Instructions — The Constant Multiplier Rule The Constant Multiplier Rule tells us how constants behave when we take derivatives. It’s the mathematical version of saying: “Scaling a process doesn’t change how fast it changes — only by how much.” 10.4.1 Step 1: Read the Expression Aloud Prompt: Read this equation aloud and explain what each part is telling you to do: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\big[c \\cdot f(x)\\big] = c \\cdot f&#39;(x) = c \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}\\big[f(x)\\big] \\] Symbol / Term What It Tells You To Do \\(c\\) \\(f(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x)\\) \\(c \\cdot f&#39;(x)\\) Notes: 10.4.2 Step 2: Translate to a Step-by-Step Recipe Activity (Think–Pair–Share): Describe the procedure this rule gives you in plain English. Identify the constant \\(c\\). Differentiate the variable part \\(f(x)\\) as usual. Keep the constant \\(c\\) in front — it “comes along for the ride.” Multiply \\(c\\) by the derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\). Now apply this recipe to three examples: Function \\(f(x)\\) Constant \\(c\\) Derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\) \\(5x^3\\) \\(-2x^4\\) \\(7\\) Notes: 10.4.3 Step 3: Deriving the Rule from the Limit Definition We can prove the rule using the limit definition of a derivative: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\] For a constant multiple \\(g(x) = c \\cdot f(x)\\): \\[ g&#39;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{c \\cdot f(x+h) - c \\cdot f(x)}{h} \\] Factor out the constant \\(c\\): \\[ g&#39;(x) = c \\cdot \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\] Recognize that the remaining limit is just \\(f&#39;(x)\\): \\[ \\boxed{g&#39;(x) = c \\cdot f&#39;(x)} \\] That’s the Constant Multiplier Rule — the constant stays the same, while the variable part changes according to its own derivative. 10.4.4 Step 4: Apply the Instructions to a Real Example Practice: Let \\(f(x) = x^2\\), and define \\(g(x) = 3f(x)\\). Identify the constant multiplier \\(c\\). Use the Power Rule to find \\(f&#39;(x)\\). Apply the Constant Multiplier Rule. Simplify the result. Interpretation: If \\(f(x)\\) describes tree height over time, multiplying by 3 simply scales the entire process — the rate of growth is three times faster, but the shape of the change is identical. Notes: 10.4.5 Step 5: Reflect — Scaling and Change Reflection Prompt: Complete this thought: “When I see \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\big[c \\cdot f(x)\\big] = c \\cdot f&#39;(x)\\), I think of it as saying ________.” Notes: 10.5 Activity: Reading Math as Instructions — The Sum and Difference Rules When we add or subtract functions, each one still changes according to its own rule. The Sum and Difference Rules tell us that differentiation distributes over addition and subtraction — you can take the derivative of each part separately and then combine the results. 10.5.1 Step 1: Read the Expression Aloud Prompt: Read the following equations aloud and describe what they’re instructing you to do: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\big[f(x) + g(x)\\big] = f&#39;(x) + g&#39;(x) \\] \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\big[f(x) - g(x)\\big] = f&#39;(x) - g&#39;(x) \\] Symbol / Term What It Tells You To Do \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x) + g&#39;(x)\\) \\(f(x) - g(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x) - g&#39;(x)\\) Notes: 10.5.2 Step 2: Translate to a Step-by-Step Recipe Activity (Think–Pair–Share): Write the recipe the Sum and Difference Rules describe in your own words. Break the function into parts being added or subtracted. Take the derivative of each part individually. Keep the same operation (addition or subtraction) between them. Simplify the result. Now apply this recipe to three quick examples: Function \\(f(x)\\) Steps You’d Take Derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\) \\(x^2 + 3x\\) \\(4x^3 - 5x^2\\) \\(2x^4 - 7x + 9\\) Notes: 10.5.3 Step 3: Deriving the Rule from the Limit Definition Let’s see how this rule arises from the limit definition of the derivative. We start with: \\[ h&#39;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h(x+h) - h(x)}{h} \\] and let \\(h(x) = f(x) + g(x)\\). Then: \\[ h&#39;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{[f(x+h) + g(x+h)] - [f(x) + g(x)]}{h} \\] Simplify: \\[ h&#39;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} + \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h} \\] Recognize each term as a derivative: \\[ \\boxed{h&#39;(x) = f&#39;(x) + g&#39;(x)} \\] The same reasoning works for subtraction: \\[ \\boxed{\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) - g(x)] = f&#39;(x) - g&#39;(x)} \\] In short — differentiation distributes over addition and subtraction. 10.5.4 Step 4: Apply the Instructions to a Real Example Practice: Let \\(f(x) = 3x^3 + 4x^2 - 10x\\). Identify how many terms there are. Apply the derivative to each term using the Power Rule. Combine the results. Simplify your answer. Notes: 10.5.5 Step 5: Visualize What’s Happening Visualization Prompt: Examine the graphs of \\(f(x) = x^2\\) and \\(g(x) = x\\). Their sum \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) combines both shapes — the derivative \\(f&#39;(x) + g&#39;(x)\\) describes how both rates of change add together at each point. What do you notice about how the slopes of the two functions interact? Notes: 10.5.6 Step 6: Reflect — Combining Changes Reflection Prompt: Complete this thought: “When I see \\(\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) \\pm g(x)] = f&#39;(x) \\pm g&#39;(x)\\), I think of it as telling me that ________.” Notes: 10.6 Practice: Identifying and Applying Derivative Rules Each of the following problems involves one or more of the basic derivative rules you’ve learned so far: Constant Rule: \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(c) = 0\\) Constant Multiplier Rule: \\(\\frac{d}{dx}[c \\cdot f(x)] = c \\cdot f&#39;(x)\\) Power Rule: \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = n x^{n-1}\\) Sum/Difference Rule: \\(\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) \\pm g(x)] = f&#39;(x) \\pm g&#39;(x)\\) For each function below: Identify which rule(s) apply. Write each step of differentiation clearly. Simplify your final answer.

Notes: 10.6.8 Problem 8 \\[ f(x) = 2(5x^3 - 4x) \\] Tasks: - Identify which rule applies first (constant multiplier or power?). - Apply the constant multiplier rule correctly. - Expand and simplify \\(f&#39;(x)\\). Notes: 10.6.9 Problem 9 \\[ f(x) = 4x^2 + 3x^{-1} - 7 \\] Tasks: - Identify the power and constant rules used. - Write each differentiation step. - Discuss what happens to the derivative as \\(x \\to 0\\). Notes: 10.6.10 Problem 10 \\[ f(x) = -6x^5 + 3x^3 - 2x + 8 \\] Tasks: - Identify all rules you’re applying. - Compute \\(f&#39;(x)\\). - Evaluate \\(f&#39;(2)\\) and interpret it as a rate of change (in context: imagine \\(f(x)\\) represents total carbon stored in a forest). Notes: 10.6.11 Challenge 1 \\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{x} \\] Notes: 10.6.12 Challenge 2 \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\] Notes: 10.6.13 Challenge 3 \\[ f(x) = x^{3/2} \\] Notes: 10.7 Workbook: Trigonometric Derivatives Learning goals Recognize and apply the derivative rules for sine, cosine, and tangent. Visually connect a function’s graph to the shape of its derivative.

Where is the slope positive/negative/zero? Mark a few key points (e.g., where slope is zero or maximally positive/negative). 10.7.2 Trig Derivative Rules (for reference) Function Derivative \\(\\sin x\\) \\(\\cos x\\) \\(\\cos x\\) \\(-\\sin x\\) \\(\\tan x\\) \\(\\sec^2 x\\) \\(\\sec x\\) \\(\\sec x \\tan x\\) \\(\\csc x\\) \\(-\\csc x \\cot x\\) \\(\\cot x\\) \\(-\\csc^2 x\\) And a reminder of some of the trig functions Function Definition (in terms of sine and cosine) \\(\\tan(x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\) \\(\\sec(x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{1}{\\cos(x)}\\) \\(\\cot(x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{\\cos(x)}{\\sin(x)}\\) \\(\\csc(x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{1}{\\sin(x)}\\) Notes: These are base identities. The ONLY when the trigonometric operator is x. In a week we’ll learn how to take the derivative of something that takes the form of \\(sin(f(x))\\) 10.7.3 Practice Problems: Trigonometric Derivatives Use the derivative rules below to find each derivative.

Visually connect the function and its derivative through growth and decay patterns. Practice applying constant multiple and sum rules with exponential and logarithmic functions. 10.8.1 Visual Warm-Up: Sketch the derivatives of \\(e^x\\), \\(a^x\\), and \\(\\ln(x)\\) Prompt: For each top plot, sketch the derivative on the corresponding blank axes below. How does the derivative compare to the original function? Where is the rate of change the greatest? Exponential &amp; Logarithmic Derivatives Function Derivative \\(a^x\\) \\(a^x \\ln(a)\\) \\(e^x\\) \\(e^x\\) \\(\\log_a(x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{1}{x \\ln(a)}\\) \\(\\ln(x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{1}{x}\\) Notes: These are base identities, valid only when the exponent or argument is x (not another function). 10.8.2 Practice Problems: Exponential and Logarithmic Derivatives Use the derivative rules above to find each derivative. Problem 1 Find the derivative of \\[ f(x) = 6e^x \\] Notes: Solution \\[ f&#39;(x) = 6e^x \\] Problem 2 Find the derivative of \\[ f(x) = 5 \\cdot 3^x \\] Notes: Solution \\[ f&#39;(x) = 5 \\cdot 3^x \\ln(3) \\] Problem 3 Find the derivative of \\[ f(x) = 4\\ln(x) - 2\\log_{10}(x) \\] Notes: Solution \\[ f&#39;(x) = 4\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) - 2\\left(\\frac{1}{x \\ln(10)}\\right) \\] 10.9 Reading Math Self Check Learning goal: Strengthen your ability to read mathematical notation and apply derivative rules that involve inner functions \\(g(x)\\). 10.9.1 Exponential and Logarithmic Rules (General Form) Function Derivative \\(a^{g(x)}\\) \\(g&#39;(x)\\, a^{g(x)} \\ln(a)\\) \\(e^{g(x)}\\) \\(g&#39;(x)\\, e^{g(x)}\\) \\(\\log_a(g(x))\\) \\(\\dfrac{g&#39;(x)}{g(x)\\ln(a)}\\) \\(\\ln(g(x))\\) \\(\\dfrac{g&#39;(x)}{g(x)}\\) 10.9.2 How to Use This Section This section is meant to help you check your understanding — without step-by-step guidance. Read each rule carefully, then apply it to the corresponding problem. Problem 1 — Using \\(a^{g(x)}\\) Rule reminder: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\big[a^{g(x)}\\big] = g&#39;(x)\\,a^{g(x)}\\ln(a) \\] Find the derivative of \\[ f(x) = 3^{2x} \\] Notes: Solution Here \\(a = 3\\) and \\(g(x) = 2x\\), so \\(g&#39;(x) = 2\\). \\[ f&#39;(x) = 2 \\cdot 3^{2x} \\ln(3) \\] Problem 2 — Using \\(e^{g(x)}\\) Rule reminder: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\big[e^{g(x)}\\big] = g&#39;(x)\\,e^{g(x)} \\] Find the derivative of \\[ f(x) = e^{5x - 1} \\] Notes: What happens if you use this rule to find the derivative of \\[ f(x) = e^{x} \\] Solution Here \\(g(x) = 5x - 1\\), so \\(g&#39;(x) = 5\\). \\[ f&#39;(x) = 5e^{5x - 1} \\] Problem 3 — Using \\(\\log_a(g(x))\\) Rule reminder: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\big[\\log_a(g(x))\\big] = \\frac{g&#39;(x)}{g(x)\\ln(a)} \\] Find the derivative of \\[ f(x) = \\log_2(x^3 + 1) \\] Notes: Solution Here \\(a = 2\\), \\(g(x) = x^3 + 1\\), and \\(g&#39;(x) = 3x^2\\). \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{3x^2}{(x^3 + 1)\\ln(2)} \\] Problem 4 — Using \\(\\ln(g(x))\\) Rule reminder: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\big[\\ln(g(x))\\big] = \\frac{g&#39;(x)}{g(x)} \\] Find the derivative of \\[ f(x) = \\ln(4x^2 + 5) \\] Notes: What happens if you use this rule to find the derivative of \\[ f(x) = \\ln(x) \\] Solution Here \\(g(x) = 4x^2 + 5\\), so \\(g&#39;(x) = 8x\\). \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{8x}{4x^2 + 5} \\] 10.9.3 Reflection Which parts of the rule notation did you initially overlook? What helped you identify \\(g(x)\\) and \\(g&#39;(x)\\) correctly? How does this process differ from using the simpler base forms like \\(e^x\\) or \\(\\ln(x)\\)? Key takeaway: Being able to “read” and interpret symbolic rules like these is a core mathematical skill — it’s not just about memorization, but about recognizing structure and patterns across different functions. 10.10 Derivative Rule Practice There are 4 sets of 5 questions. Each question has a function for which you must find the derivative. There is also a followup questions for each questions Solutions for these five are hidden behind a password at the bottom (once you are done - ask one of us) Derivative Applications (Set 1 of 4) 1. \\(f(x)=8x^{5/2}-6x^{3/2}+4x^{1/2}\\) Follow-up: For \\(x&gt;0\\), describe how the sign of \\(f&#39;(x)\\) changes as \\(x\\) increases. (Does the slope stay positive, become negative, or switch direction?) Math Hint Use the Power Rule: \\(\\frac{d}{dx}x^n = n x^{n-1}\\). Each term keeps a positive coefficient, so think about how the powers affect growth. Conceptual Phone a Friend Differentiate each term and notice that as \\(x\\) grows, the higher-power term \\(x^{3/2}\\) grows fastest. That means the slope increases for large \\(x\\) but could be smaller near \\(x=0\\). 2. \\(f(x)=5x^{-3}+2x^{-1/2}-7\\) Follow-up: What is the sign of \\(f&#39;(x)\\) when \\(x=0.5\\)? Explain why. Math Hint Power Rule again. Don’t forget the negative signs that appear when differentiating negative exponents. Conceptual Phone a Friend At small \\(x\\), terms with higher negative powers dominate because they “blow up.” Ask which derivative term—steeply negative or mildly negative—controls the overall direction of change. 3. \\(f(x)=x^4-8x^2+16\\) Follow-up: Identify the points where the tangent line is horizontal. Math Hint Apply the Power Rule term-by-term; combine like terms neatly. You’ll get a polynomial you can factor. Conceptual Phone a Friend A “horizontal tangent” means the slope momentarily stops increasing or decreasing. Think of it as the peak or valley of the curve—places where growth pauses before reversing. 4. \\(f(x)=2x^{1/3}-3x^{2/3}+4x^{5/3}\\) Follow-up: How does the derivative behave near \\(x=0\\)? Math Hint Be meticulous with fractional powers: \\(x^{1/3}\\), \\(x^{2/3}\\), \\(x^{5/3}\\). Subtract 1 from each exponent carefully. Conceptual Phone a Friend Negative exponents create division by small numbers. As \\(x\\to0\\), imagine the graph’s slope stretching vertically — the function’s rate of change explodes rather than settling. 5. \\(f(x)=9x^6-5x^3+1\\) Follow-up: What happens to the slope as \\(x\\to\\infty\\)? Math Hint Differentiate each term using the Power Rule. Keep coefficients exact; the highest power dictates long-term growth. Conceptual Phone a Friend For very large \\(x\\), the biggest power term outweighs all others. Picture a rocket—lower-order terms fade as the \\(x^6\\) term propels the slope steeply upward.  Answer Key (Questions 1 – 5) Click to Unlock Solutions 1. Derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=20x^{3/2}-9x^{1/2}+2x^{-1/2}\\). Follow-up answer: For small \\(x\\), the \\(2x^{-1/2}\\) term dominates, so \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is positive and large. As \\(x\\) increases, \\(20x^{3/2}\\) eventually becomes dominant and positive as well, so the slope stays positive for all \\(x&gt;0\\). Thus \\(f(x)\\) is increasing on \\((0,\\infty)\\). 2. Derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=-15x^{-4}-x^{-3/2}\\). Follow-up answer: At \\(x=0.5\\), both terms are negative and large in magnitude, so \\(f&#39;(0.5)&lt;0\\). The function is decreasing there (the higher-order negative power dominates). 3. Derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=4x^3-16x=4x(x^2-4)\\). Follow-up answer: Horizontal tangents where \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\): \\(x=-2,\\,0,\\,2\\). 4. Derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=\\tfrac{2}{3}x^{-2/3}-2x^{-1/3}+\\tfrac{20}{3}x^{2/3}\\). Follow-up answer: As \\(x\\to0^+\\), the \\(\\tfrac{2}{3}x^{-2/3}\\) term dominates (the most singular), so \\(f&#39;(x)\\to +\\infty\\). 5. Derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=54x^5-15x^2\\). Follow-up answer: As \\(x\\to\\infty\\), the \\(54x^5\\) term dominates, so \\(f&#39;(x)\\to+\\infty\\) (slope grows rapidly positive). Unlock Note: JavaScript is required to unlock solutions. Derivative Applications (Set 2 of 4) 6. \\(f(x)=x^{4}-x^{3}\\) Follow-up: Solve \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) and list all \\(x&gt;0\\) where the tangent is horizontal. Math Hint Differentiate term-by-term: \\((x^4)&#39;=4x^3\\), \\((x^3)&#39;=3x^2\\). You’ll get \\(f&#39;(x)=4x^3-3x^2\\). Factor out the largest common power of \\(x\\). Conceptual Phone a Friend Horizontal tangents occur where the slope is zero. A repeated factor like \\(x^2\\) means the graph “flattens” at that \\(x\\) (multiplicity \\(&gt;1\\)) and may not change direction there. 7. \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{x}+\\dfrac{3}{x^2}\\) Follow-up: Find \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\). Math Hint Rewrite as powers: \\(\\sqrt{x}=x^{1/2}\\) and \\(3/x^2=3x^{-2}\\). Differentiate once to get \\(f&#39;(x)=\\tfrac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}-6x^{-3}\\). Differentiate again—each exponent decreases by 1 each time. Conceptual Phone a Friend You’re differentiating the derivative again to find how the slope \\(f&#39;(x)\\) changes. Simplify your final expression to write \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) with clean coefficients and exponents. 8. \\(f(x)=4x^{3/2}+7x^{-1/2}-5x\\) Follow-up: Does \\(f&#39;(x)\\) change sign as \\(x\\) increases from \\(0.1\\) to \\(10\\)? Briefly justify. Math Hint Differentiate carefully: the derivative will have one positive-power term and two with exponents \\(1/2\\) and \\(-3/2\\). Evaluate the sign of \\(f&#39;(x)\\) for a small \\(x\\) (e.g., \\(0.1\\)) and a large \\(x\\) (e.g., \\(10\\)). Conceptual Phone a Friend For tiny \\(x\\), the \\(x^{-3/2}\\) term dominates (very negative). For large \\(x\\), the \\(x^{1/2}\\) term dominates (positive). If a continuous derivative goes from negative to positive on an interval, it must cross zero somewhere in between. 9. \\(f(x)=6x^{4}-9x^{1/2}+2x^{-1}\\) Follow-up: Which term dominates \\(f&#39;(x)\\) for large \\(x\\)? For small \\(x&gt;0\\)? State the sign in each case. Math Hint Differentiate and compare the exponents in \\(f&#39;(x)\\). As \\(x\\to\\infty\\), highest positive power wins; as \\(x\\to0^+\\), the most negative exponent wins. Conceptual Phone a Friend Dominance is about “who grows fastest.” Big positive powers explode for large \\(x\\); steep negative powers explode near zero. Use that to predict the sign of the slope in each regime. 10. \\(f(x)=5x^{2/3}-3x^{1/3}+7\\) Follow-up: Compute \\(f&#39;(1)\\). Then describe what happens to \\(f&#39;(x)\\) as \\(x\\to0^+\\). Math Hint Apply the fractional Power Rule carefully: \\(\\dfrac{d}{dx}x^{p} = p\\,x^{p-1}\\). Substitute \\(x=1\\) after you simplify \\(f&#39;(x)\\). Conceptual Phone a Friend Near \\(x=0^+\\), terms like \\(x^{-1/3}\\) and \\(x^{-2/3}\\) can blow up. Decide which negative fractional power drives the behavior and whether it sends the slope toward \\(+\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\).  Answer Key (Questions 6 – 10) Click to Unlock Solutions 6. Derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=4x^{3}-3x^{2}=x^{2}(4x-3)\\). Follow-up answer: Roots at \\(x=0\\) (double root) and \\(x=\\tfrac{3}{4}\\). Since the prompt asks for \\(x&gt;0\\), the horizontal tangent occurs at \\(x=\\tfrac{3}{4}\\) (note: \\(x=0\\) is also a horizontal tangent but is not \\(&gt;0\\)). 7. Derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=\\tfrac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}-6x^{-3}\\). Second derivative: \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)=-\\tfrac{1}{4}x^{-3/2}+18x^{-4}\\). 8. Derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=6x^{1/2}-\\tfrac{7}{2}x^{-3/2}-5\\). Follow-up answer: For small \\(x\\) (e.g., \\(0.1\\)), the \\(-\\tfrac{7}{2}x^{-3/2}\\) term dominates \\(\\Rightarrow f&#39;(x)&lt;0\\). For large \\(x\\) (e.g., \\(10\\)), \\(6x^{1/2}\\) dominates \\(\\Rightarrow f&#39;(x)&gt;0\\). By continuity on \\([0.1,10]\\) (IVT), \\(f&#39;\\) changes sign, so \\(\\exists\\,c\\in(0.1,10)\\) with \\(f&#39;(c)=0\\). 9. Derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=24x^{3}-\\tfrac{9}{2}x^{-1/2}-2x^{-2}\\). Follow-up answer: As \\(x\\to\\infty\\), \\(24x^{3}\\) dominates \\(\\Rightarrow f&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) (large positive). As \\(x\\to0^+\\), \\(-2x^{-2}\\) dominates \\(\\Rightarrow f&#39;(x)\\to-\\infty\\) (large negative). 10. Derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=\\tfrac{10}{3}x^{-1/3}-x^{-2/3}\\). Follow-up answer: \\(f&#39;(1)=\\tfrac{10}{3}-1=\\tfrac{7}{3}&gt;0\\). As \\(x\\to0^+\\), the \\(-x^{-2/3}\\) term dominates, so \\(f&#39;(x)\\to-\\infty\\). Unlock Note: JavaScript is required to unlock solutions. Derivative Applications (Set 3 of 4) 11. \\(f(x)=6\\sin x-3\\cos x+2\\) Follow-up: Explain why \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) has infinitely many solutions. Math Hint Differentiate using \\((\\sin x)&#39;=\\cos x\\) and \\((\\cos x)&#39;=-\\sin x\\). You’ll get a combination of sine and cosine—both periodic functions. Conceptual Phone a Friend Because sine and cosine repeat every \\(2\\pi\\), any equation like \\(A\\cos x + B\\sin x = 0\\) will also repeat its zeros every period. That’s why the slope \\(f&#39;(x)\\) equals zero infinitely many times. 12. \\(f(x)=4x^2+3\\sin x\\) Follow-up: At \\(x=\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}\\), which term contributes more to \\(f&#39;(x)\\)? Math Hint Differentiate to get a polynomial term and a cosine term. Then plug in \\(x=\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}\\). Conceptual Phone a Friend At \\(x=\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(\\cos x=0\\). Compare that with the linear-in-\\(x\\) term from the polynomial derivative. 13. \\(f(x)=2e^{x}-5x^{2}+1\\) Follow-up: Find \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\), \\(f&#39;&#39;&#39;(x)\\), and \\(f^{(4)}(x)\\), what will happen if you keep going? Math Hint Differentiate term by term. Remember: the derivative of \\(e^{x}\\) is itself, and powers of \\(x\\) follow the Power Rule. Keep track of signs—each new derivative reduces the degree of the polynomial part. Conceptual Phone a Friend Notice that the exponential term never disappears under differentiation, while the polynomial part eventually becomes constant and then \\(0\\). This highlights the difference between exponential and algebraic growth. 14. \\(f(x)=7x^{3}+e^{x}\\) Follow-up: Which term dominates \\(f&#39;(x)\\) as \\(x\\to -\\infty\\)? As \\(x\\to+\\infty\\)? Math Hint Differentiate to a sum of a polynomial and an exponential. Compare sizes in each limit. Conceptual Phone a Friend As \\(x\\to -\\infty\\), exponentials collapse toward \\(0\\) while even powers of \\(x\\) grow large (but positive). As \\(x\\to+\\infty\\), exponentials eventually outgrow any polynomial. 15. \\(f(x)=3\\sin x+e^{x}\\) Follow-up: Find \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\). Math Hint Differentiate term by term: \\((\\sin x)&#39;=\\cos x\\) and \\((e^{x})&#39;=e^{x}\\). Repeat once more to get the second derivative. Conceptual Phone a Friend Compare how the exponential and trigonometric parts behave. The exponential term keeps growing, while sine and cosine oscillate between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\).  Answer Key (Questions 11 – 15) Click to Unlock Solutions 11. Derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=6\\cos x+3\\sin x.\\) Follow-up answer: The equation \\(6\\cos x+3\\sin x=0\\) simplifies to \\(\\tan x=-2\\). Since \\(\\tan x\\) has period \\(\\pi\\), this equality recurs every \\(\\pi\\) units, so there are infinitely many \\(x\\) satisfying \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\). 12. Derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=8x+3\\cos x.\\) Follow-up answer: At \\(x=\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}\\), \\(f&#39;(x)=8\\cdot \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}+3\\cdot 0=4\\pi\\). The polynomial term dominates; the trig term contributes \\(0\\). 13. First derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=2e^{x}-10x\\) Second derivative: \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)=2e^{x}-10\\) Third derivative: \\(f&#39;&#39;&#39;(x)=2e^{x}\\) Fourth derivative: \\(f^{(4)}(x)=2e^{x}\\) Follow-up answer: The exponential term \\(2e^{x}\\) remains unchanged with each derivative, while the polynomial part vanishes after two differentiations. 14. Derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=21x^{2}+e^{x}.\\) Follow-up answer: As \\(x\\to-\\infty\\), \\(e^{x}\\to0\\) and \\(21x^{2}\\) dominates (positive). As \\(x\\to+\\infty\\), both terms increase, but \\(e^{x}\\) eventually dominates any polynomial. 15. First derivative: \\(f&#39;(x)=3\\cos x+e^{x}\\) Second derivative: \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)=-3\\sin x+e^{x}\\) Unlock Note: JavaScript is required to unlock solutions. Derivative Applications (Set 4 of 4) 16. \\(f(x)=e^{\\,5x^{3}+3x-\\ln x}\\) Follow-up: Describe what happens to \\(f&#39;(x)\\) as \\(x\\) becomes large. Math Hint Use the identity \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\big(e^{g(x)}\\big)=g&#39;(x)e^{g(x)}. \\] First find \\(g&#39;(x)\\) for \\(g(x)=5x^{3}+3x-\\ln x\\), then look at the signs of \\(g&#39;(x)\\) and \\(e^{g(x)}\\) when \\(x\\) is large. Conceptual Phone a Friend Remember that \\(e^{g(x)}\\) is always positive. If \\(g&#39;(x)\\) grows quickly and stays positive for large \\(x\\), then \\(f&#39;(x)\\) will also grow rapidly.

So \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\big(15x^{2}+3-\\tfrac{1}{x}\\big)e^{\\,5x^{3}+3x-\\ln x}. \\] Follow-up answer: As \\(x\\) becomes large, \\(15x^{2}+3-\\tfrac{1}{x}\\approx15x^{2}\\) (positive and increasing), and \\(e^{\\,5x^{3}+3x-\\ln x}\\) grows extremely fast.

It’s the mathematical version of saying: “When two things change together, each one’s rate of change contributes to the total change.” 10.11.1 Step 1: Read the Expression Aloud Prompt: Read this equation aloud and explain what each part is telling you to do: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\big[f(x) \\cdot g(x)\\big] = f&#39;(x)g(x) + f(x)g&#39;(x) \\] Symbol / Term What It Tells You To Do \\(f(x)\\) \\(g(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x)\\) \\(g&#39;(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x)g(x) + f(x)g&#39;(x)\\) Notes: 10.11.2 Step 2: Translate to a Step-by-Step Recipe Activity (Think–Pair–Share): Describe the procedure this rule gives you in plain English. Identify the two factors — call them \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\). Differentiate the first one (\\(f(x)\\)) and keep the second one the same. Then keep the first one the same and differentiate the second one (\\(g(x)\\)). Add both results together. Now apply this recipe to a few examples: Function \\(h(x)\\) \\(f(x)\\) \\(g(x)\\) \\(h&#39;(x)\\) \\(x^2 \\sin(x)\\) \\(e^x \\ln(x)\\) \\((3x-1)(2x^2+5)\\) Notes: 10.11.3 Step 3: Deriving the Rule from the Limit Definition If we start from the limit definition of the derivative: \\[ (fg)&#39; = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)g(x+h) - f(x)g(x)}{h} \\] We can add and subtract \\(f(x+h)g(x)\\) to rearrange the expression: \\[ (fg)&#39; = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)g(x+h) - f(x+h)g(x) + f(x+h)g(x) - f(x)g(x)}{h} \\] Group and factor terms: \\[ (fg)&#39; = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\Big[ f(x+h)\\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h} + g(x)\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \\Big] \\] As \\(h \\to 0\\), the limits become: \\[ \\boxed{(fg)&#39; = f&#39;(x)g(x) + f(x)g&#39;(x)} \\] That’s the Product Rule — both parts “help” with the change. 10.11.4 Step 4: Apply the Instructions to a Real Example Practice: Let \\(f(x) = x^2\\) and \\(g(x) = \\sin(x)\\). Use the Product Rule to find \\(\\dfrac{d}{dx}\\big[f(x)g(x)\\big]\\). Identify \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\). Compute \\(f&#39;(x)\\) and \\(g&#39;(x)\\). Substitute into \\(f&#39;(x)g(x) + f(x)g&#39;(x)\\). Simplify. Interpretation (everyday): Imagine you run a small bakery. \\(f(x)\\) represents how many trays of cookies you bake per hour — your production speed. \\(g(x)\\) represents how many cookies you put on each tray — your batch size. Your total cookie output per hour is \\(f(x) \\times g(x)\\). Both of those quantities can change — maybe you’re baking faster as you get into a rhythm, or maybe you start adding more cookies per tray as demand increases. The Product Rule tells you how your total production rate changes when both factors are changing at once: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f&#39;(x)g(x) + f(x)g&#39;(x) \\] The first term, \\(f&#39;(x)g(x)\\), represents the effect of baking trays faster (speed increasing) while the number of cookies per tray stays the same. The second term, \\(f(x)g&#39;(x)\\), represents the effect of adding more cookies per tray while baking speed stays the same. Together, they show that your total output can rise faster when both your speed and your batch size grow. That’s what the Product Rule captures: two changing things, both contributing to the total change. Notes: Interpretation (environmental): Now imagine an ecosystem instead of a bakery. \\(f(x)\\) represents the amount of plant biomass — how much living material there is per hectare. \\(g(x)\\) represents the rate of photosynthesis per unit biomass — how productive each unit of plant matter is. The total carbon fixed per hectare is \\(f(x) \\times g(x)\\). Both factors can change over time: forests grow, increasing total biomass (\\(f(x)\\) rises), and environmental conditions (light, water, temperature) alter photosynthetic efficiency (\\(g(x)\\) changes). The Product Rule describes how total carbon uptake changes when both of these processes evolve together: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f&#39;(x)g(x) + f(x)g&#39;(x) \\] \\(f&#39;(x)g(x)\\): added carbon uptake because biomass is growing, even if efficiency stays the same. \\(f(x)g&#39;(x)\\): added carbon uptake because each unit of biomass is working harder, even if biomass stays fixed. Together, these terms explain how ecosystems can accelerate or slow their overall productivity — it’s not just how much life there is, but also how efficiently that life converts sunlight into energy. The Product Rule captures how those two changing processes interact to drive total change. Notes: 10.11.5 Step 5: Reflect — When Two Things Change Together Reflection Prompt: Complete this thought: “When I see \\(\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f&#39;(x)g(x) + f(x)g&#39;(x)\\), I think of it as saying ________.” Notes: 10.11.6 Step 6: Quick Practice — Apply the Product Rule Instructions: Use the Product Rule to find the derivative of each function. Show your steps clearly and simplify your final answers. 1. \\(h(x) = x^2 \\sin(x)\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) — 2. \\(h(x) = (3x^2 + 1)(2x - 5)\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) 3. \\(h(x) = e^x \\ln(x)\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) 4. \\(h(x) = x \\cos(x)\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) 5. \\(h(x) = \\sqrt{x}(x^2 + 4)\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) Notes: 10.12 Activity: Reading Math as Instructions — The Quotient Rule The Quotient Rule tells us how to take the derivative of one function divided by another. It’s the mathematical version of saying: “When one changing quantity is divided by another, both affect how fast the ratio itself changes.” 10.12.1 Step 1: Read the Expression Aloud Prompt: Read this equation aloud and explain what each part is telling you to do: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\right] = \\frac{f&#39;(x)g(x) - f(x)g&#39;(x)}{[g(x)]^2} \\] Symbol / Term What It Tells You To Do \\(f(x)\\) \\(g(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x)\\) \\(g&#39;(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x)g(x) - f(x)g&#39;(x)\\) \\([g(x)]^2\\) Notes: 10.12.2 Step 2: Translate to a Step-by-Step Recipe Activity (Think–Pair–Share): Describe the procedure this rule gives you in plain English. Identify the top and bottom functions — call them \\(f(x)\\) (top) and \\(g(x)\\) (bottom). Differentiate the top (\\(f&#39;(x)\\)) and keep the bottom the same. Subtract the top times the derivative of the bottom (\\(f(x)g&#39;(x)\\)). Divide the entire numerator by the square of the bottom, \\([g(x)]^2\\). Now apply this recipe to a few examples: Function \\(h(x)\\) \\(f(x)\\) \\(g(x)\\) \\(h&#39;(x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{x^2}{\\sin(x)}\\) \\(\\dfrac{e^x}{x^2}\\) \\(\\dfrac{3x^2+1}{2x-5}\\) Notes: 10.12.3 Step 3: Deriving the Rule from the Product Rule We can use the Product Rule and the Power Rule to derive the Quotient Rule. Since dividing by \\(g(x)\\) is the same as multiplying by \\(g(x)^{-1}\\): \\[ \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = f(x)\\cdot g(x)^{-1} \\] Differentiate using the Product Rule: \\[ (fg^{-1})&#39; = f&#39;(x)g(x)^{-1} + f(x)(-1)g(x)^{-2}g&#39;(x) \\] Simplify: \\[ \\boxed{\\frac{f&#39;(x)g(x) - f(x)g&#39;(x)}{[g(x)]^2}} \\] That’s the Quotient Rule — “low d-high minus high d-low, over low squared.” 10.12.4 Step 4: Apply the Instructions to Real Examples Practice: Let \\(f(x) = x^2\\) and \\(g(x) = \\sin(x)\\). Use the Quotient Rule to find \\(\\dfrac{d}{dx}\\!\\left[\\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\right]\\). Identify \\(f(x)\\) (top) and \\(g(x)\\) (bottom). Compute \\(f&#39;(x)\\) and \\(g&#39;(x)\\). Substitute into \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\!\\left[\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\right] = \\frac{f&#39;(x)g(x) - f(x)g&#39;(x)}{[g(x)]^2} \\] Simplify. Interpretation (everyday): Imagine you’re tracking your miles per gallon while driving. \\(f(x)\\) represents miles traveled, which increases over time. \\(g(x)\\) represents gallons of fuel used, which also changes as you drive. Your fuel efficiency — miles per gallon — is the ratio \\(f(x)/g(x)\\). Both the distance and the fuel consumption are changing, so the rate of change of efficiency depends on how they change relative to each other. The Quotient Rule tells us exactly how that balance shifts: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\!\\left[\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\right] = \\frac{f&#39;(x)g(x) - f(x)g&#39;(x)}{[g(x)]^2} \\] The first term, \\(f&#39;(x)g(x)\\), shows the effect of driving farther while fuel use stays steady. The second term, \\(f(x)g&#39;(x)\\), subtracts the effect of burning fuel faster. Dividing by \\([g(x)]^2\\) keeps everything scaled to “per gallon.” If you’re traveling more miles but also burning fuel faster, your efficiency might stay flat or drop — the Quotient Rule captures how competing changes in numerator and denominator interact. Interpretation (environmental): Now think about a lake ecosystem where scientists study nutrient efficiency. \\(f(x)\\) represents total biomass (algae and plants) — the numerator. \\(g(x)\\) represents available nutrients (like nitrogen or phosphorus) — the denominator. The ratio \\(f(x)/g(x)\\) measures how efficiently the ecosystem turns nutrients into biomass. Both can change: biomass grows as organisms reproduce, and nutrient levels fall as they’re consumed. The Quotient Rule describes how efficiency changes when both processes shift at once: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\!\\left[\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\right] = \\frac{f&#39;(x)g(x) - f(x)g&#39;(x)}{[g(x)]^2} \\] \\(f&#39;(x)g(x)\\): efficiency rises because biomass is increasing (numerator growing). \\(f(x)g&#39;(x)\\): efficiency falls because nutrients are being depleted (denominator shrinking). Dividing by \\([g(x)]^2\\) reflects that the smaller the resource pool, the more sensitive the ratio becomes to change. This shows why nutrient-use efficiency can fluctuate even if total biomass is steady — small shifts in either growth or nutrient supply can strongly affect the balance. Notes: 10.12.5 Step 5: Reflect — “Low d-High Minus High d-Low” Reflection Prompt: Complete this thought: “When I see \\(\\dfrac{d}{dx}\\!\\left[\\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\right] = \\dfrac{f&#39;(x)g(x) - f(x)g&#39;(x)}{[g(x)]^2}\\), I think of it as saying ________.” Notes: 10.12.6 Step 6: Quick Practice — Apply the Quotient Rule Instructions: Use the Quotient Rule to find the derivative of each function. Simplify your answers where possible. 1. \\(h(x) = \\dfrac{x^2 + 1}{x}\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) 2. \\(h(x) = \\dfrac{e^x}{x^2 + 1}\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) 3. \\(h(x) = \\dfrac{\\ln(x)}{x^3}\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) 4. \\(h(x) = \\dfrac{x}{\\cos(x)}\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) 5. \\(h(x) = \\dfrac{x^2 + 4x}{3x - 2}\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) Notes: 10.13 Activity: Reading Math as Instructions — The Chain Rule The Chain Rule tells us how to take the derivative of a composition of functions — when one function is inside another. It’s the mathematical version of saying: “When a change depends on something else that’s also changing, the total rate combines both.” 10.13.1 Step 1: Read the Expression Aloud Prompt: Read this equation aloud and explain what each part is telling you to do: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\big[f(g(x))\\big] = f&#39;(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x) \\] Symbol / Term What It Tells You To Do \\(f(g(x))\\) \\(f&#39;(g(x))\\) \\(g(x)\\) \\(g&#39;(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x)\\) Notes: 10.13.2 Step 2: Translate to a Step-by-Step Recipe Activity (Think–Pair–Share): Describe the procedure this rule gives you in plain English. Identify the outer function \\(f(\\,\\cdot\\,)\\). Identify the inner function \\(g(x)\\). Differentiate the outer function, keeping the inside the same: \\(f&#39;(g(x))\\). Multiply by the derivative of the inner function \\(g&#39;(x)\\). Now apply this recipe to a few examples: Function \\(h(x)\\) Outer \\(f(\\cdot)\\) Inner \\(g(x)\\) \\(h&#39;(x)\\) \\((3x^2 + 1)^4\\) \\(\\sin(5x)\\) \\(e^{x^3}\\) Notes: 10.13.3 Step 3: Deriving the Rule Conceptually If \\(y = f(u)\\) and \\(u = g(x)\\), then small changes relate as: \\[ \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dx} \\] That is — a change in \\(x\\) causes a change in \\(u\\), which in turn causes a change in \\(y\\). The total effect multiplies these two rates. This idea gives us: \\[ \\boxed{\\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f&#39;(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x)} \\] The Chain Rule captures how nested change works — one rate feeding into another. 10.13.4 Step 4: Apply the Instructions to Real Examples Practice Example 1 — Everyday Context: Let \\(f(u) = u^2\\) and \\(g(x) = 3x + 2\\). Then \\(h(x) = f(g(x)) = (3x + 2)^2\\). \\[ h&#39;(x) = f&#39;(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x) = 2(3x + 2) \\cdot 3 = 6(3x + 2) \\] Interpretation (everyday): Imagine a conveyor belt feeding into a machine. \\(g(x)\\): how fast the belt moves — converting time to position. \\(f(u)\\): how output depends on belt position — converting position to output. If the belt speeds up, the output changes faster — not just because the machine reacts, but because the input itself is changing more quickly. The Chain Rule captures this change of a change — when one process drives another. Practice Example 2 — Environmental Context: Let \\(f(T)\\) be the rate of photosynthesis depending on temperature, and \\(T(t)\\) be the temperature changing over the course of a day. Then total photosynthesis rate over time is \\(f(T(t))\\). The derivative is: \\[ \\frac{d}{dt}[f(T(t))] = f&#39;(T(t)) \\cdot T&#39;(t) \\] \\(f&#39;(T(t))\\): how sensitive photosynthesis is to temperature. \\(T&#39;(t)\\): how quickly the temperature is changing at that time. Together, they show how rapidly the system’s productivity responds to both environmental sensitivity and rate of temperature change. If temperature rises quickly during midday (\\(T&#39;(t)\\) large) and plants are temperature-sensitive (\\(f&#39;(T(t))\\) large), the total rate of change in photosynthesis spikes — a real-world Chain Rule in action. Notes: 10.13.5 Step 5: Reflect — When One Change Depends on Another Reflection Prompt: Complete this thought: “When I see \\(\\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f&#39;(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x)\\), I think of it as saying ________.” Notes: 10.13.6 Step 6: Quick Practice — Apply the Chain Rule 1. \\(h(x) = (3x^2 + 1)^5\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) 2. \\(h(x) = \\sin(4x)\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) 3. \\(h(x) = e^{x^3}\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) 4. \\(h(x) = \\sqrt{5x + 2}\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) 5. \\(h(x) = \\ln(7x^2 - 3)\\) \\(h&#39;(x) = \\, ?\\) 10.14 Implicit Differentiation The Implicit Differentiation Rule tells us how to find \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) when \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are entangled in the same equation. It’s the mathematical version of saying: “When two variables change together to maintain a relationship, we can still find how fast one changes relative to the other.” 10.14.1 Step 1: See It — Why Implicit Differentiation Is Needed Visual Example: The Curve \\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\\) Let’s start with a simple relationship: \\[ x^2 + y^2 = 25 \\] This equation defines a circle — all points \\((x, y)\\) that are 5 units away from the origin. Notice something important: you can’t write this as a single function \\(y = f(x)\\) because for most \\(x\\)-values, there are two possible \\(y\\)-values (one above, one below the \\(x\\)-axis). That’s exactly where implicit differentiation comes in. We can still find the slope of the curve at any given point — even when \\(y\\) isn’t isolated. 10.14.2 Step 3: Connect to Real-World Systems Example — Environmental Relationship Suppose a forest’s carbon assimilation rate \\(A\\) depends on both temperature \\(T\\) and light intensity \\(L\\): \\[ A(T, L) = k(T - 5)(L - 100) \\] If the system maintains constant assimilation (\\(A = A_0\\)), then \\(T\\) and \\(L\\) must co-adjust to keep that equality true. Differentiate both sides with respect to \\(T\\): \\[ k[(L - 100) + (T - 5)\\frac{dL}{dT}] = 0 \\] Solve for \\(\\frac{dL}{dT}\\): \\[ \\frac{dL}{dT} = -\\frac{L - 100}{T - 5} \\] Interpretation: To keep carbon assimilation constant, light must decrease as temperature increases. Implicit differentiation captures this interdependence — how one variable’s change must compensate for another’s. Notes: 10.14.3 Step 4: Reflect — When Two Variables Depend on Each Other Reflection Prompt: Complete this thought: “When I see an equation like \\(x^2 + y^2 = 25\\), I think of it as saying ________.” Notes: 10.14.4 Step 6: Quick Practice — Apply Implicit Differentiation Differentiate each equation implicitly with respect to \\(x\\), then solve for \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\). Each problem highlights a slightly different rule (product, chain, exponential, or logarithmic). 1. \\(x^2y + 3y^2 = 12\\) \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\, ?\\) 2. \\(e^{x+y} = xy\\) \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\, ?\\) 3. \\(\\sin(x + y) = y^2\\) \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\, ?\\) 4. \\(x^3 + y^3 + 6xy = 7\\) \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\, ?\\) 5. \\(\\ln(xy) = x - y\\) \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\, ?\\) Challenge question: For the curve \\(x^2 + xy + y^2 = 7\\), find the slope at the point \\((2,1)\\). (Hint: use your \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) expression, then substitute.) Takeaway: These examples combine multiple differentiation rules — power, product, chain, exponential, and logarithmic — all within one equation. Implicit differentiation is the glue that connects them, letting you find slopes even when \\(y\\) can’t be isolated. 10.15 Mixed Rule Practice How to Approach Mixed-Rule Derivative Problems When a function combines multiple differentiation rules — product, quotient, chain, and even implicit differentiation — the key is organization, not speed. Here’s a systematic way to stay in control: 1. Identify the outermost structure first Before differentiating anything, ask: &gt; “What is the main operation holding this function together?” Is the whole expression a quotient (something divided by something)? A product (two factors multiplied)? A composition (a function inside another)? 2. Differentiate layer by layer, not all at once Treat each layer like peeling an onion: Apply the outer rule (product, quotient, or chain). Pause — identify any new inner functions that appear. Then differentiate those carefully before moving deeper. Example thought process: &gt; “The outermost layer is a quotient, &gt; the numerator has a product, &gt; and one of those products contains a chain rule.” That’s already your roadmap. 3. Use clear labels for sub-functions Name inner pieces temporarily: \\[ N(x) = (x^2 + y^3)e^{\\sin(x^2)}, \\quad D(x) = \\sin(\\ln((x e^x + 1)^2)). \\] Then compute \\(N&#39;(x)\\) and \\(D&#39;(x)\\) separately. You’ll make fewer algebraic mistakes and can check each part for correctness. 4. Watch for implicit terms (\\(y\\)) Whenever \\(y\\) appears without being defined as a function of \\(x\\), remember: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}(y^n) = n y^{n-1} y&#39;. \\] This keeps your derivative consistent when later solving for \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\). 5. Don’t simplify until the end (or at all) Simplifying while differentiating hides structure and multiplies errors. Instead: Keep parentheses intact. Factor only if it clarifies a repeated term. Box your final unsimplified result, then simplify only if needed. 6. Build a mental checklist Rule Typical Signal Inner derivative? Common pitfall Product factors joined by “×” No forgetting both parts Quotient fraction No missing a negative Chain nested parentheses Yes dropping inner derivative Implicit \\(y\\) terms Yes forgetting \\(y&#39;\\) Exponential / log powers, \\(e^{g(x)}\\), \\(\\ln(g(x))\\) Yes misusing log base 7. Practice combining two rules first Before tackling “Frankenstein” problems, build fluency with pairs. 1. Product + Chain Find \\(f&#39;(x)\\) for \\[ f(x) = x^2 e^{3x+1}. \\] Solution We have a product of \\(x^2\\) and \\(e^{3x+1}\\). Use Product Rule: \\((uv)&#39; = u&#39;v + uv&#39;\\). \\[ \\begin{aligned} f&#39;(x) &amp;= (2x)e^{3x+1} + x^2 \\frac{d}{dx}\\!\\big[e^{3x+1}\\big] \\\\ &amp;= 2x e^{3x+1} + x^2 e^{3x+1}(3) \\\\ &amp;= e^{3x+1}\\,(2x + 3x^2). \\end{aligned} \\] No simplification required. 2. Quotient + Chain Find \\(f&#39;(x)\\) for \\[ f(x) = \\frac{\\sin(2x)}{x^3 + 1}. \\] Solution Apply the Quotient Rule: \\[ \\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right)&#39; = \\frac{u&#39;v - uv&#39;}{v^2}. \\] \\[ \\begin{aligned} u(x) &amp;= \\sin(2x) &amp;\\Rightarrow&amp;\\ u&#39;(x) = \\cos(2x)\\cdot 2 = 2\\cos(2x),\\\\ v(x) &amp;= x^3 + 1 &amp;\\Rightarrow&amp;\\ v&#39;(x) = 3x^2. \\end{aligned} \\] \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{(2\\cos(2x))(x^3+1) - \\sin(2x)(3x^2)}{(x^3+1)^2}. \\] No simplification required. 3. Quotient + Chain Find \\(f&#39;(x)\\) for \\[ f(x) = \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{2x}{x^3 + 1}\\right). \\] Solution We have a chain rule (outer sine) whose inner function is a quotient. So the Quotient Rule appears inside the chain. Outer function: \\[ f(x) = \\sin(g(x)) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad f&#39;(x) = \\cos(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x). \\] Inner function: \\[ g(x) = \\frac{2x}{x^3 + 1}. \\] Apply the Quotient Rule to \\(g(x)\\): \\[ g&#39;(x) = \\frac{(2)(x^3 + 1) - 2x(3x^2)}{(x^3 + 1)^2} = \\frac{2x^3 + 2 - 6x^3}{(x^3 + 1)^2} = \\frac{2 - 4x^3}{(x^3 + 1)^2}. \\] Now combine both results: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2x}{x^3 + 1}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2 - 4x^3}{(x^3 + 1)^2}. \\] No simplification required. 4. Chain + Implicit Differentiate implicitly: \\[ \\cos(y) = x^2 + 3y. \\] Solution Differentiate both sides with respect to \\(x\\): \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}[\\cos(y)] = \\frac{d}{dx}[x^2 + 3y]. \\] Left side (Chain Rule): \\[ -\\sin(y) \\cdot y&#39; = 2x + 3y&#39;. \\] Now isolate \\(y&#39;\\): \\[ -\\sin(y)\\,y&#39; - 3y&#39; = 2x, \\] \\[ y&#39;(-\\sin(y) - 3) = 2x, \\] \\[ \\boxed{y&#39; = \\frac{2x}{-\\sin(y) - 3}}. \\] No simplification required. Key takeaway: Mixed-rule problems aren’t harder because they’re longer — they’re harder because they require knowing what rule to apply when. Slowing down and naming each layer keeps everything under control. Environmental Applications Logistic Growth Model The logistic growth model describes how a population evolves when growth is limited by resource availability. 1. Population Model We begin with a population \\(P(t)\\) that grows over time \\(t\\), approaching a maximum sustainable size \\(K\\), called the carrying capacity. The logistic model expresses this as: \\[ P(t) = \\frac{K}{1 + A e^{-rt}}, \\] where: - \\(K\\) = carrying capacity - \\(r\\) = intrinsic growth rate - \\(A = \\frac{K - P_0}{P_0}\\), determined by the initial population \\(P_0\\) 2. Derivative — The Logistic Differential Equation Differentiating \\(P(t)\\) with respect to time gives the rate of population change: \\[ \\frac{dP}{dt} = rP\\!\\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K}\\right). \\] This is the logistic differential equation, which captures the feedback between population size and resource limits. 3. Interpretation When \\(P\\) is small, \\((1 - P/K) \\approx 1\\), and growth is approximately exponential: \\[ \\frac{dP}{dt} \\approx rP. \\] As \\(P\\) increases, \\((1 - P/K)\\) decreases, slowing growth. When \\(P = K\\): \\[ \\frac{dP}{dt} = 0, \\] meaning the population stabilizes at carrying capacity. 4. Growth Phases Phase Condition Behavior Initial \\(P \\ll K\\) Nearly exponential growth Midpoint \\(P = \\tfrac{K}{2}\\) Maximum growth rate Late \\(P \\to K\\) Growth slows and levels off 5. Key Insight The logistic model formalizes self-limiting growth: as population size increases, available resources per individual decrease, reducing the overall growth rate. It serves as the foundation for many ecological and environmental system models. 6. Complex Relationships Real systems often have parameters that change over time (or with environment). Below are simple, smooth functions for the logistic model’s parameters and how they appear when substituted into the population model. Simple time-varying parameters Let \\[ \\begin{aligned} r(t) &amp;= r_0 \\;+\\; \\alpha\\sin(2\\pi t) \\quad &amp;&amp;\\text{(seasonal growth rate)},\\\\[2pt] K(t) &amp;= K_0\\!\\left[1+\\varepsilon\\cos(2\\pi t)\\right] \\quad &amp;&amp;\\text{(seasonal carrying capacity)},\\\\[2pt] A(t) &amp;= A_0\\!\\left[1+\\delta e^{-t}\\right] \\quad &amp;&amp;\\text{(transient offset)}. \\end{aligned} \\] All amplitudes satisfy \\(\\alpha,\\varepsilon,\\delta\\ge 0\\) and are chosen so \\(K(t)&gt;0\\) for all \\(t\\). Substitution into the population model The constant-parameter logistic solution is \\[ P(t)=\\frac{K}{1+A\\,e^{-rt}}. \\] \\[ P(t)= \\frac{K}{1+A\\, \\exp\\!\\left( -r_0t-\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi}\\big(1-\\cos(2\\pi t)\\big) \\right)}. \\]  Frankenstein’s Derivative You’ve learned how the product, quotient, chain, and implicit differentiation rules connect — now you’ll bring them all together in one (truly monstrous) expression.

By studying derivatives, we can see where a system is growing, slowing, or reversing direction — and what those shifts mean in an environmental context. We’ll use first derivatives to identify where the function is increasing or decreasing and to locate extrema — points where growth stops and reverses. We’ll use second derivatives to understand how that rate of change itself is evolving — whether growth is accelerating, slowing, or approaching a tipping point. Together, these tools allow us to interpret a system’s story: when it’s changing most rapidly, when it levels off, and when it begins to turn — revealing the dynamic patterns that shape natural processes. 11.2 Guided Activity — Using Derivatives to Find Extremes This activity will help you explore how derivatives identify extrema — the highest and lowest points of a system’s behavior. 11.2.1 Thinking About Extremes Before jumping into equations, think about these situations: Scenario What variable reaches a high or low point? What does that point mean ecologically? A glacier’s melt rate throughout the summer Algal population growth as nutrient levels rise Temperature of a lake over a 24-hour cycle Rainfall-runoff relationship during a storm Prompt: In each case, what would the slope of the curve (the derivative) tell you? When might that slope be zero? 11.2.2 Visualizing Local and Global Extrema In this section we will interpret these functions and points of interest. Visual Observations Panel What kind of extrema do you see? Where does the curve rise/fall? Any flat regions? A B C D 11.2.3 Local vs. Global Thinking Using what you’ve seen: How is a local extremum different from a global extremum? Why can endpoints matter when the domain is limited (like daily radiation between sunrise and sunset)? 11.2.4 Connecting to Derivatives We Are “Difference Machines” Our brains are wired to notice change, not constancy. If a light stays on, we stop seeing it. If a sound is steady, it fades into the background. But when something shifts — brightness flickers, volume drops, temperature rises — our attention snaps to it instantly. Your mind is not recording the world frame by frame — it’s continuously comparing what just happened to what’s happening now. We don’t process absolute information; we process differences. Why We Measure Change Environmental scientists do the same thing. We rarely ask, “What is the exact value right now?” Instead, we ask: - How fast is the glacier melting? - Is the population growing or shrinking? - How quickly is CO₂ increasing? - When does the trend reverse? These are all questions about change, not state. Just as our brains focus on shifting inputs, our mathematical tools — derivatives — are designed to measure how one quantity changes relative to another. The Calculus Connection The first derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\) measures how fast something changes — our mathematical version of noticing movement, drift, or growth. The second derivative \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) measures how the rate of change itself evolves — like sensing acceleration or sudden reversals. Both capture what your brain already prioritizes: difference and change over time. At each peak or valley, the slope of the tangent line is zero. Observation Symbolic Meaning Real-World Analogy Curve is increasing \\(f&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) Lake temperature rising during morning Curve is decreasing \\(f&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\) River discharge falling after storm peak Curve flattens \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) Population growth stops accelerating Finding Critical Points How can we use \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) to predict where peaks and valleys occur before plotting the function? 11.2.5 Classify Behavior from the Derivative For each derivative, decide where the function is increasing, decreasing, or flat and over which intervals? Note we don’t have the function here - just its derivative. Derivative Expression Critical points of \\(f&#39;(x)\\) Behavior of \\(f(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 - 6x\\) \\(f&#39;(x) = -2(x-3)\\) \\(f&#39;(x) = 4x^3 - 10x\\) There will be times where factoring isn’t simple. IF the function is quadratic you can always use the quadratic formula which gives the solutions (or roots) of a quadratic equation \\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\] and is written as: \\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\] How to build a sign chart \\(f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 - 6x\\) \\(f&#39;(x) = -2(x-3)\\) \\(f&#39;(x) = 4x^3 - 10x\\) 11.2.6 Apply to a New Example Let’s model population dynamics of bears: \\[ P(t) = -t^3 + 6t^2 - 9t + 20 \\] Prompts Between which time intervals does the population increase or decrease? At what points might \\(P&#39;(t) = 0\\)? Which point seems to be a local maximum and which a local minimum? How could this correspond to resource limitation or recovery in an ecosystem? What might happen if external factors (like drought or nutrient input) shifted these extrema? 11.2.7 Investigating the Derivative Now that you’ve visualized the population curve, let’s explore how its rate of change behaves. We’ll look at the derivative \\(P&#39;(t)\\), which tells us whether the population is growing or shrinking at any moment. Prompts Where does \\(P&#39;(t) = 0\\)? Between which values of \\(t\\) is \\(P&#39;(t)\\) positive or negative? How does the sign of \\(P&#39;(t)\\) relate to whether \\(P(t)\\) is increasing or decreasing? How do these intervals correspond to growth and decline phases in a population? What might cause these transitions in a real system (e.g., changes in food, space, or temperature)? 11.2.8 Linking Derivatives to System Behavior Use your graph to fill in the table below. Observation Derivative Sign Population Behavior Ecological Meaning \\(P&#39;(t) &gt; 0\\) Positive \\(P(t)\\) increasing Growth phase — population expanding \\(P&#39;(t) = 0\\) Zero Slope of \\(P(t)\\) flat Turning point — possible max or min \\(P&#39;(t) &lt; 0\\) Negative \\(P(t)\\) decreasing Decline — competition or limitation 11.2.9 Adding the Second Derivative Next, explore the curvature of population change — whether the growth rate itself is speeding up or slowing down. We’ll look at the second derivative \\(P&#39;&#39;(t)\\). Prompts Where does \\(P&#39;&#39;(t) = 0\\)? What happens to \\(P&#39;(t)\\) and \\(P(t)\\) near this point? How does the curvature (concavity) change before and after \\(P&#39;&#39;(t) = 0\\)? What does a positive \\(P&#39;&#39;(t)\\) tell you about the rate of change? What does a negative \\(P&#39;&#39;(t)\\) indicate about slowing or reversing growth? In ecological terms, how might this point represent a tipping point or carrying capacity? Now consider the second derivative, which describes how the rate of change itself is changing. Use this table to connect the sign of \\(P&#39;&#39;(t)\\) with system behavior. Observation Second Derivative Sign Curvature / Behavior of \\(P(t)\\) Ecological Meaning \\(P&#39;&#39;(t) &gt; 0\\) Positive Concave up — slope of \\(P(t)\\) increasing Growth is accelerating; system recovering or resources increasing \\(P&#39;&#39;(t) = 0\\) Zero Point of inflection — curvature changes sign Tipping point where growth shifts from accelerating to slowing \\(P&#39;&#39;(t) &lt; 0\\) Negative Concave down — slope of \\(P(t)\\) decreasing Growth is slowing; system approaching carrying capacity or limitation Discussion When \\(P&#39;(t) = 0\\), what does this mean physically in the system? When \\(P&#39;&#39;(t) = 0\\), what does this indicate about how the rate of change itself is behaving? How could identifying inflection points help forecast environmental transitions before they occur? Think of a real example — such as CO₂ uptake by vegetation, or lake temperature over a year. Where might you expect maxima, minima, and inflection points to occur? What could each tell you about system resilience or change? Big Takeaway: - \\(f&#39;(x)\\) shows how fast something changes. - \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) shows how that rate itself changes. - Together, they reveal whether a system is accelerating, stabilizing, or reversing — the mathematical fingerprints of environmental balance. 11.3 Sign Chart Practice Worksheet Goal: Practice creating first and second derivative sign charts for both original functions and their derivatives — learning to infer how a system behaves from either starting point. Each part contains two examples: - One starting from the original function \\(f(x)\\). - One starting from the derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\). 11.3.1 Part 1 — Polynomial Patterns A. Start from \\(f(x)\\) Given \\[ f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 \\] Solution First compute derivatives. \\[ f&#39;(x)=3x^2 - 6x = 3x(x-2),\\qquad f&#39;&#39;(x)=6x - 6 = 6(x-1). \\] For the first derivative sign chart, the critical points are \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=2\\). Testing intervals: For \\(x&lt;0\\), both factors are negative, so \\(f&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) and the function is increasing. For \\(0&lt;x&lt;2\\), the first factor is positive and the second is negative, so \\(f&#39;(x)&lt;0\\) and the function is decreasing. For \\(x&gt;2\\), both factors are positive, so \\(f&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) and the function increases again. Thus a local maximum occurs at \\(x=0\\) and a local minimum at \\(x=2\\). For the second derivative, \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)=6(x-1)\\), which changes sign at \\(x=1\\). - For \\(x&lt;1\\), \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&lt;0\\): concave down. - For \\(x&gt;1\\), \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&gt;0\\): concave up. This marks an inflection point at \\(x=1\\). Putting the information together: The function rises to a local max at \\(x=0\\), falls to a local min at \\(x=2\\), and switches concavity at \\(x=1\\). A sketch shows increasing → decreasing → increasing behavior, with concave down before \\(x=1\\) and concave up afterward. B. Start from \\(f&#39;(x)\\) Given \\[ f&#39;(x)=2x(3-x) \\] Solution Critical points occur at \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=3\\). Testing signs: For \\(x&lt;0\\), the first factor is negative, the second is positive, so \\(f&#39;(x)&lt;0\\): the function decreases. For \\(0&lt;x&lt;3\\), both factors are positive, so \\(f&#39;(x)&gt;0\\): the function increases. For \\(x&gt;3\\), the first factor is positive and the second is negative, so \\(f&#39;(x)&lt;0\\): the function decreases. This gives a local minimum at \\(x=0\\) and a local maximum at \\(x=3\\). To analyze concavity, compute \\[ f&#39;(x)=6x - 2x^2 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad f&#39;&#39;(x)=6 - 4x. \\] The second derivative equals zero at \\(x=1.5\\). - For \\(x&lt;1.5\\), \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&gt;0\\): concave up. - For \\(x&gt;1.5\\), \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&lt;0\\): concave down. Thus the function changes concavity at \\(x=1.5\\). A sketch follows a decrease → increase → decrease pattern with concave up before \\(1.5\\) and concave down after. 11.3.2 Part 2 — Factored Derivatives and Flat Points (Corrected) 11.3.2.1 A. Start from \\(f(x)\\) \\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 3x^2 + 4x \\] Solution ✔️ Corrected Solution 1. First and second derivatives \\[ f&#39;(x) = -3x^2 + 6x + 4 \\] \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x) = -6x + 6 = -6(x-1) \\] 2. Critical points and monotonicity Solve \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\): \\[ -3x^2 + 6x + 4 = 0 \\] \\[ 3x^2 - 6x - 4 = 0 \\] \\[ x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 + 48}}{6} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{84}}{6} = 1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{3} \\] So the critical points are: \\[ x_1 = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{3} \\approx -0.53 \\] \\[ x_2 = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{3} \\approx 2.53 \\] Sign of \\(f&#39;(x)\\): \\(x=-1\\): \\(f&#39;(-1) = -5 &lt; 0\\) → decreasing \\(x=0\\): \\(f&#39;(0) = 4 &gt; 0\\) → increasing \\(x=3\\): \\(f&#39;(3) = -5 &lt; 0\\) → decreasing Thus: Decreasing on \\((-\\infty,\\;1-\\tfrac{\\sqrt{21}}{3})\\) Increasing on \\(\\left(1-\\tfrac{\\sqrt{21}}{3},\\;1+\\tfrac{\\sqrt{21}}{3}\\right)\\) Decreasing on \\(\\left(1+\\tfrac{\\sqrt{21}}{3},\\;\\infty\\right)\\) Critical point classification: At \\(x_1\\): negative → positive ⇒ local minimum At \\(x_2\\): positive → negative ⇒ local maximum 3. Concavity and inflection point \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x) = -6(x-1) \\] If \\(x &lt; 1\\): \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) ⇒ concave up If \\(x &gt; 1\\): \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\) ⇒ concave down So: Concave up on \\((-\\infty, 1)\\) Concave down on \\((1, \\infty)\\) Inflection point at: \\[ x = 1 \\] 4. Overall behavior Decreasing → local minimum at \\(x = 1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{3}\\) Increasing → local maximum at \\(x = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{3}\\) Decreasing again Concave up for \\(x&lt;1\\), concave down for \\(x&gt;1\\), with an inflection at \\(x=1\\) 11.3.2.2 B. Start from \\(f&#39;(x)\\) \\[ f&#39;(x)= -3(x-1)(x+2)^2 \\] Solution The derivative is zero at \\(x=1\\) and at \\(x=-2\\) (with multiplicity 2). Because \\((x+2)^2\\) is always nonnegative and never changes sign, only the factor \\((x-1)\\) controls sign changes (and the leading \\(-3\\) flips everything). Testing intervals: For \\(x&lt;-2\\), \\((x-1)&lt;0\\), the square is positive, and the leading \\(-3\\) makes the sign positive; the function increases. For \\(-2&lt;x&lt;1\\), \\((x-1)&lt;0\\), sign remains the same, so the function now decreases. For \\(x&gt;1\\), \\((x-1)&gt;0\\), and the leading \\(-3\\) makes the product negative; the function continues decreasing. Notably, the slope touches zero at \\(x=-2\\) but the sign does not change — a flat point, not an extremum. A local maximum occurs at \\(x=1\\). For concavity, differentiate: \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=-3\\Big[(x+2)^2 + 2(x-1)(x+2)\\Big] =-9x(x+2). \\] Concavity changes at \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=-2\\). This gives multiple concavity regions and an inflection at \\(x=0\\); \\(x=-2\\) also behaves like an inflection but with a flat slope. 11.3.3 Part 3 — Exponential Behavior 11.3.3.1 A. Start from \\(f(x)\\) \\[ f(x)=e^x(x-2) \\] Solution Compute derivatives: \\[ f&#39;(x)=e^x(x-1), \\qquad f&#39;&#39;(x)=e^x x. \\] For \\(f&#39;(x)\\), the slope is zero at \\(x=1\\). - For \\(x&lt;1\\), the factor \\((x-1)\\) is negative → decreasing. - For \\(x&gt;1\\), the factor is positive → increasing. Thus there is a local minimum at \\(x=1\\). For the second derivative, \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)=e^x x\\) changes sign at \\(x=0\\). - For \\(x&lt;0\\), negative → concave down. - For \\(x&gt;0\\), positive → concave up. So inflection at \\(x=0\\). Long-term behavior: As \\(x\\to\\infty\\), the exponential dominates and \\(f(x)\\to\\infty\\). As \\(x\\to-\\infty\\), the exponential goes to zero from the negative side, and \\(f(x)\\to 0^{-}\\). 11.3.4 Part 4 — Undefined Derivatives and Asymptotes 11.3.4.1 A. Start from \\(f(x)\\) \\[ f(x)=\\frac{x}{x-1} \\] Solution Differentiate: \\[ f&#39;(x)= -\\frac{1}{(x-1)^2},\\qquad f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{2}{(x-1)^3}. \\] The first derivative is never zero, so the function has no local maxima or minima. It is always decreasing because the numerator is \\(-1\\) and the square in the denominator is always positive. Both derivatives are undefined at \\(x=1\\), giving a vertical asymptote. The second derivative changes sign at the asymptote: - Left of 1, the denominator is negative → \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&lt;0\\): concave down. - Right of 1, the denominator is positive → \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&gt;0\\): concave up. The function approaches the horizontal asymptote \\(y=1\\) as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\). 11.3.4.2 B. Start from \\(f&#39;(x)\\) \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{e^x(x^2-4)}{x-2} \\] Solution The derivative is zero when \\(x^2-4=0\\), so at \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=2\\). It is undefined at \\(x=2\\) because the denominator also becomes zero there. Break the real line at \\(-2\\) and \\(2\\). Testing intervals: For \\(x&lt;-2\\), \\(x^2-4&gt;0\\) and the denominator is negative, so the slope is negative: the function decreases. For \\(-2&lt;x&lt;2\\), \\(x^2-4&lt;0\\) but the denominator is also negative, so slope is positive: the function increases. For \\(x&gt;2\\), both numerator and denominator are positive, so slope is positive: the function continues increasing. Thus there is a local minimum at \\(x=-2\\). At \\(x=2\\), the derivative is undefined; this usually signals a vertical asymptote or sharp corner. The function increases on both sides of \\(x=2\\). 11.3.5 Reflection — From Slopes to Shapes Solution Starting from \\(f(x)\\) means you compute everything from scratch; starting from \\(f&#39;(x)\\) forces you to infer the function’s shape from slope information. From \\(f&#39;(x)\\) alone, you can determine where the function increases or decreases, where maxima and minima occur, and whether there might be asymptotes. To know concavity or inflection points, though, you need \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\). In environmental contexts, maxima might represent carrying capacities or peak resources, minima might represent low points in population or nutrient availability, and inflection points often mark transitions such as switching from accelerating to slowing growth. 11.4 Challenge Problems — Sign Charts &amp; Shape Analysis Each problem includes three reveal options: - Check 1st derivative - Check 2nd derivative - Full solution at the end password will be shared at the end of clas Challenge 1 — Hidden Factor Structure Given \\[ f(x) = (x^2 - 4)e^{-x} \\] Check 1st derivative Differentiate using the product rule: \\[ f&#39;(x) = e^{-x}(-x^2 + 2x + 4) \\] Critical points come from the quadratic: \\[ -x^2 + 2x + 4 = 0 \\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0 \\] Roots: \\[ x = 1 \\pm \\sqrt{5} \\qquad (\\approx -1.236,\\; 3.236) \\] Sign pattern (downward-opening parabola): - Negative for \\(x &lt; 1 - \\sqrt{5}\\) - Positive for \\(1 - \\sqrt{5} &lt; x &lt; 1 + \\sqrt{5}\\) - Negative for \\(x &gt; 1 + \\sqrt{5}\\) Check 2nd derivative Differentiate again: \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)= e^{-x}(x^2 - 4x - 2) \\] Inflection points come from: \\[ x^2 - 4x - 2 = 0 \\] Solutions: \\[ x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{6} \\qquad (\\approx -0.449,\\; 4.449) \\] Since the quadratic opens upward: - Positive for \\(x &lt; 2 - \\sqrt6\\) - Negative for \\(2 - \\sqrt6 &lt; x &lt; 2 + \\sqrt6\\) - Positive for \\(x &gt; 2 + \\sqrt6\\) Concavity: - Concave up before \\(2 - \\sqrt{6}\\) - Concave down between \\(2 - \\sqrt{6}\\) and \\(2 + \\sqrt{6}\\) - Concave up after \\(2 + \\sqrt{6}\\) Challenge 2 — Rational Function With Two Asymptotes \\[ f(x)=\\frac{1}{x^2 - 1} \\] Check 1st derivative Differentiate using the chain rule: \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{-2x}{(x^2 - 1)^2}. \\] Critical point comes from the numerator: \\[ -2x = 0 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad x = 0. \\] Derivative is undefined at: \\[ x = -1,\\qquad x = 1 \\] These are vertical asymptotes. Sign chart: Increasing on \\((-\\infty,-1)\\) and \\((-1,0)\\) Decreasing on \\((0,1)\\) and \\((1,\\infty)\\) Thus the function has a local maximum at: \\[ f(0) = -1. \\] Check 2nd derivative After simplification, the second derivative is: \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{6x^2 + 2}{(x^2 - 1)^3}. \\] The numerator is always positive, so concavity is determined by the denominator. Breakpoints for concavity: \\(x = -1,\\; x = 1\\) (vertical asymptotes) Test intervals: Interval Sign of \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) Concavity \\((-\\infty, -1)\\) + Concave up \\((-1, 1)\\) – Concave down \\((1, \\infty)\\) + Concave up There is no inflection point, because concavity changes only across discontinuities. Challenge 3 — Repeated Critical Point + Multiple Inflection Points \\[ f(x)=x^4 - 4x^3 \\] Check 1st derivative Differentiate: \\[ f&#39;(x)=4x^3 - 12x^2 = 4x^2(x - 3) \\] Critical points: \\(x = 0\\) (double root) \\(x = 3\\) Sign pattern: For \\(x &lt; 3\\): \\(x-3 &lt; 0\\), and \\(4x^2 \\ge 0\\) ⇒ \\(f&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\) For \\(x &gt; 3\\): \\(x-3 &gt; 0\\), \\(f&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) Thus: Decreasing on \\((-\\infty, 3)\\) Increasing on \\((3, \\infty)\\) At \\(x = 0\\), slope is zero but no sign change ⇒ a flat point, not an extremum At \\(x = 3\\), slope switches from − to + ⇒ local minimum Check 2nd derivative Differentiate again: \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=12x^2 - 24x = 12x(x - 2) \\] Inflection points occur where \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)=0\\): \\[ x = 0, \\quad x = 2 \\] Concavity pattern (test the sign of \\(f&#39;&#39;\\)): For \\(x &lt; 0\\): both \\(x\\) and \\(x-2\\) negative ⇒ \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) → concave up For \\(0 &lt; x &lt; 2\\): \\(x &gt; 0\\) but \\(x-2 &lt; 0\\) ⇒ \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\) → concave down For \\(x &gt; 2\\): both factors positive ⇒ \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) → concave up So concavity transitions: \\[ \\text{concave up} \\;\\to\\; \\text{concave down} \\;\\to\\; \\text{concave up} \\] with legitimate inflection points at \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 2\\). Challenge 4 — Always Increasing, Multiple Inflection Points \\[ f(x)=\\frac{e^{x}}{x^{2}+1} \\] NOTE: Factoring the second derivative is beyond the scope of this class so use this as the second derivative and its critical points to construct a sign chart. Thus the real solutions of \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)=0\\) occur at \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)= \\frac{ e^{x}\\left(x^{4}-4x^{3}+8x^{2}-4x-1\\right) }{ (x^{2}+1)^{3} }. \\] \\[ x \\approx -0.18, \\qquad x = 1. \\] Check 1st derivative Differentiate: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{e^x(x^2+1) - e^x(2x)}{(x^2+1)^2} = \\frac{e^x(x^2 - 2x + 1)}{(x^2+1)^2}. \\] Factor the numerator: \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{e^x (x-1)^2}{(x^2+1)^2}. \\] All factors are nonnegative, and the derivative is zero only when \\(x=1\\). The function is therefore increasing for all real \\(x\\), with a horizontal tangent at \\(x=1\\) but no local extremum there. Check 2nd derivative Differentiate \\(f&#39;(x)=e^x(x-1)^2(x^2+1)^{-2}\\): \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)= \\frac{ e^{x}\\left(x^{4}-4x^{3}+8x^{2}-4x-1\\right) }{ (x^{2}+1)^{3} }. \\] The denominator is always positive, so the sign depends on the numerator \\[ x^{4}-4x^{3}+8x^{2}-4x-1. \\] Factoring shows it equals \\[ (x-1)\\bigl(x^{3}-3x^{2}+5x+1\\bigr). \\] Thus the real solutions of \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)=0\\) occur at \\[ x \\approx -0.18, \\qquad x = 1. \\] Testing each interval gives the concavity pattern: up on \\((-\\infty,\\; -0.18)\\) down on \\((-0.18,\\; 1)\\) up on \\((1,\\; \\infty)\\) So the function has two inflection points and remains always increasing. Challenge 5 — A Function With an S-Shaped Curve Consider the function \\[ f(x)=\\frac{50}{1+2e^{-x}}. \\] Compute \\(f&#39;(x)\\) and \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\). Determine intervals of increase/decrease and concavity. Identify any critical points and inflection points. Check the long-term limits: What happens to \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\to -\\infty\\)? What happens to \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\to +\\infty\\)? Sketch the curve and label the important features. Have you seen an equation with this structure in any of your other classes? Check 1st derivative Rewrite the function as \\[ f(x)=50(1+2e^{-x})^{-1}. \\] Differentiate: \\[ f&#39;(x)=50\\cdot(-1)(1+2e^{-x})^{-2}\\cdot(2e^{-x}\\cdot -1) =\\frac{100e^{-x}}{(1+2e^{-x})^2}. \\] Rewriting using \\(e^x\\): \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{100e^{x}}{(e^{x}+2)^2}. \\] All factors are positive, so \\(f&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) for every real \\(x\\). The function is increasing everywhere. Check 2nd derivative Differentiating using the form \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{100e^{x}}{(e^{x}+2)^2} \\] gives, after simplification: \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{100e^{x}(2 - e^{x})}{(e^{x}+2)^3}. \\] The denominator is positive for all \\(x\\). Thus the sign comes from \\((2 - e^{x})\\): For \\(x &lt; \\ln 2\\): \\(e^{x}&lt;2\\) and \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&gt;0\\), so the graph is concave up. For \\(x &gt; \\ln 2\\): \\(e^{x}&gt;2\\) and \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&lt;0\\), so the graph is concave down. There is an inflection point at \\[ x = \\ln 2. \\] 11.4.1 Solution to Challenge Problems Full Challenge Solutions CHALLEGE 1 Solution Start with: \\[ f&#39;(x) = 2xe^{-x} + (x^2 - 4)(-e^{-x}) = e^{-x}(-x^2 + 2x + 4). \\] Since \\(e^{-x} &gt; 0\\), the sign of the derivative is controlled by \\(-x^2 + 2x + 4\\), which has roots \\[ x = 1 - \\sqrt5 \\approx -1.236, \\qquad x = 1 + \\sqrt5 \\approx 3.236. \\] Sign analysis: - Decreasing on \\((-\\infty, 1 - \\sqrt5)\\) - Increasing on \\((1 - \\sqrt5,\\; 1 + \\sqrt5)\\) - Decreasing on \\((1 + \\sqrt5, \\infty)\\) Thus: - Local maximum at \\(x = 1 - \\sqrt5\\) - Local minimum at \\(x = 1 + \\sqrt5\\) Next, \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)= e^{-x}(x^2 - 4x - 2). \\] The quadratic has roots: \\[ x = 2 - \\sqrt6 \\approx -0.449, \\qquad x = 2 + \\sqrt6 \\approx 4.449. \\] Because the quadratic opens upward, the concavity pattern is: - Concave up for \\(x &lt; 2 - \\sqrt6\\) - Concave down for \\(2 - \\sqrt6 &lt; x &lt; 2 + \\sqrt6\\) - Concave up for \\(x &gt; 2 + \\sqrt6\\) Thus the function has two inflection points, one on each side of where the exponential begins to dominate. The complete shape: - Decreasing → increasing → decreasing - Inflection → concave down → inflection - Exponential factor affects magnitude but not sign behavior CHALLEGE 2 Solution 1. First derivative analysis \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{-2x}{(x^2 - 1)^2} \\] Critical point: \\[ x = 0. \\] Increasing on: \\[ (-\\infty,-1),\\qquad (-1,0) \\] Decreasing on: \\[ (0,1),\\qquad (1,\\infty) \\] So the function has a local maximum at: \\[ f(0) = -1. \\] 2. Asymptote analysis (limits) The function is undefined at: \\[ x=-1,\\qquad x=1 \\] Asymptote at \\(x=-1\\) \\[ \\lim_{x\\to -1^-} f(x) = +\\infty, \\qquad \\lim_{x\\to -1^+} f(x) = -\\infty \\] So \\(x=-1\\) is a vertical asymptote. Asymptote at \\(x=1\\) \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 1^-} f(x) = -\\infty, \\qquad \\lim_{x\\to 1^+} f(x) = +\\infty \\] So \\(x=1\\) is also a vertical asymptote. 3. Second derivative and concavity \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{6x^2 + 2}{(x^2 - 1)^3} \\] The numerator \\(6x^2+2\\) is always positive, so concavity is determined entirely by the denominator. Concavity pattern: - Concave up on \\((-\\infty,-1)\\) - Concave down on \\((-1,1)\\) - Concave up on \\((1,\\infty)\\) There are no inflection points, because the concavity change occurs at vertical asymptotes. 4. Complete shape One critical point → local max at \\(x=0\\) Vertical asymptotes at \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=1\\) Concavity: up → down → up Function breaks naturally into three separate branches CHALLEGE 3 Solution 1. First derivative and monotonicity \\[ f&#39;(x)=4x^2(x - 3) \\] Zeros at: \\(x = 0\\) (double root → slope flattens but does not change sign) \\(x = 3\\) (simple root → sign change) Sign pattern: \\(f&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\) for all \\(x &lt; 3\\) \\(f&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) for all \\(x &gt; 3\\) Thus: Always decreasing before \\(x = 3\\) Always increasing after \\(x = 3\\) A local minimum at \\(x = 3\\) A flat point but no extremum at \\(x = 0\\) 2. Concavity (second derivative) \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x) = 12x(x - 2) \\] Set second derivative = 0: \\(x = 0\\) \\(x = 2\\) Concavity pattern: Concave up for \\(x &lt; 0\\) Concave down for \\(0 &lt; x &lt; 2\\) Concave up for \\(x &gt; 2\\) Thus there are two inflection points: \\[ x = 0, \\qquad x = 2 \\] 3. Overall behavior and sketch description The function decreases steadily until \\(x = 3\\), where it achieves a local minimum. After \\(x = 3\\), it increases forever. Concavity: Up before 0 Down between 0 and 2 Up after 2 Inflection points at \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 2\\). The point \\(x = 0\\) is especially interesting: the slope is zero there but the graph is still decreasing. This gives the characteristic “flatten → dip → rise” shape typical of a quartic with asymmetric coefficients. CHALLEGE 4 Solution The first derivative is \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{e^x (x-1)^2}{(x^2+1)^2}, \\] which is never negative and equals zero only at \\(x=1\\). Thus the function is increasing everywhere, with a horizontal tangent at \\(x=1\\) but no local maximum or minimum. For concavity, the correct second derivative is \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)= \\frac{ e^{x}\\left(x^{4}-4x^{3}+8x^{2}-4x-1\\right) }{ (x^{2}+1)^{3} }, \\] and the sign depends on the numerator \\[ x^{4}-4x^{3}+8x^{2}-4x-1 = (x-1)\\bigl(x^{3}-3x^{2}+5x+1\\bigr). \\] The cubic has one real root (the other two are complex), located at \\[ x \\approx -0.18, \\] along with the linear-factor root at \\(x=1\\). These give the two real inflection points of the function. Testing each interval shows the concavity pattern: concave up on \\((-\\infty,\\,-0.18)\\) concave down on \\((-0.18,\\;1)\\) concave up on \\((1,\\;\\infty)\\) Summary: The function rises smoothly for all \\(x\\), flattens at \\(x=1\\) without forming an extremum, and changes concavity twice, creating two inflection points while remaining always increasing. CHALLEGE 5 Solution The derivative \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{100e^{x}}{(e^{x}+2)^2} \\] is positive for all real \\(x\\), so the function has no local maxima or minima and increases steadily for all inputs. The second derivative \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{100e^{x}(2 - e^{x})}{(e^{x}+2)^3} \\] changes sign when \\(e^{x}=2\\). This occurs at \\(x=\\ln 2\\), which is an inflection point. The concavity structure is: concave up for \\(x&lt;\\ln 2\\) concave down for \\(x&gt;\\ln 2\\) For the long-term limits: As \\(x\\to -\\infty\\), \\(e^{-x}\\to\\infty\\), so the denominator \\(1+2e^{-x}\\) becomes very large and \\[ \\lim_{x\\to -\\infty} f(x)=0. \\] As \\(x\\to +\\infty\\), \\(e^{-x}\\to 0\\), so the denominator approaches \\(1\\) and \\[ \\lim_{x\\to +\\infty} f(x)=50. \\] The resulting graph has a smooth S-shape, increases for all \\(x\\), and levels off near these two horizontal limits.

Optimization is the process of finding the best possible outcome in a system with limits or tradeoffs. In environmental science, we often want to maximize something beneficial or minimize something harmful, all while respecting ecological, physical, or budget constraints. 12.1.1 Key Ideas A decision variable: The thing we can change (e.g., planting density, harvest rate, flow release, fertilizer amount). An objective function \\(f(x)\\): A mathematical expression that links our decision variable \\(x\\) to the environmental outcome we care about. A goal: Either to maximize (e.g., carbon uptake, yield, biodiversity) or minimize (e.g., pollution, cost, heat stress). Constraints: The natural or practical limits that shape the feasible range of \\(x\\). Tradeoffs: Improving one outcome often reduces another; optimization finds the most effective balance. Derivatives as tools: \\(f&#39;(x)\\) shows where the function is increasing or decreasing. Critical points (where \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\)) are candidates for max/min. \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) helps determine whether those points are peaks or valleys. Interpretation in context: The mathematical optimum must be evaluated in ecological, ethical, and practical terms. 12.1.2 Why It Matters in Environmental Sciences Optimization helps us answer questions like: What management strategy gives the highest benefit with the lowest impact? How do we use limited resources most efficiently? Where is the “sweet spot” that balances productivity, cost, and sustainability? In short, optimization allows us to make informed, mathematically justified decisions in complex environmental systems. 12.2 Qualitative Optimizating Qualitative Case Study — Finding the Optimal Amount of Sleep Everyone knows that sleep matters. But the relationship between hours of sleep and how well you function the next day is not linear. Too little sleep leaves you exhausted. Too much sleep can make you groggy or unfocused or perhaps not enough time to do what needs to get done. Somewhere in the middle is your personal “sweet spot.” The goal of this activity is to help you think like an optimizer before we introduce any formulas. 1. Daily Experience (No math yet) Think about a typical night of sleep. Describe, in your own words, what happens when you get: Very little sleep (0–3 hours): ____________________ A moderate amount of sleep (6–9 hours): ____________________ Excessive sleep (11–14 hours): ____________________ 2. What are we optimizing? In this situation: What is the decision variable (the thing you can adjust)? ______________ What is the outcome you care about (the “objective”)? ______________ Are you trying to maximize or minimize this outcome? ______________ 3. Describe the general shape Based on your lived experience, sketch how “next-day functioning” should change as sleep hours increase. 4. Identify the “optimal point” qualitatively Where (roughly) do you think the maximum occurs for you? _____ hours Why does performance fall again after too much sleep? ___________________ 5. Reflection (one sentence) Write a single sentence that captures the idea behind optimization using the sleep example: __________________ Qualitative Case Study — Allocating Study Time Between Two Classes to Optimize GPA Imagine you are taking two classes this quarter. You start with different grades in each class, and you have limited study time. Your goal is to decide how to split your study hours to get the highest possible GPA. This activity helps you think about optimization through a real student-centered decision. 1. Your starting point (no math yet) Suppose: In Class A, you’re starting strong. Your current grade already reflects good understanding. In Class B, you’re struggling more. Your current grade is lower and needs improvement. Fill in your own version: Starting grade in Class A: _____% Starting grade in Class B: _____% 2. What can you control? You cannot instantly change your grades, but you can change how you distribute your time. What is your decision variable here? ________ Are there one or two decision variables? Explain: ________ What is the outcome you want to optimize? (Examples: GPA, average grade, exam performance) ________ 3. Think about the tradeoffs Studying more in one class usually means less time for the other. Consider: If you spend almost all your time on Class A, what happens to Class B? ________ If you focus heavily on Class B, what happens to Class A? ________ Why might neither extreme be optimal? ________ 4. Describe the “shape” of each class’s improvement curve Imagine the effect of study hours on each class: Class A: You already understand the material. Extra study helps, but each additional hour helps less (diminishing returns). Describe the curve qualitatively: _________ Class B: You’re behind at the start. The first few hours help a lot, but the benefits eventually level off. Describe the curve qualitatively: _________ 5. Putting the system together You have a fixed number of study hours, say 10 hours. Let: \\(x\\) = hours you spend on Class B \\(10 - x\\) = hours you spend on Class A Without writing formulas, describe how you could: Represent how your grade in Class A depends on \\(10 - x\\): _________ Represent how your grade in Class B depends on \\(x\\): _________ Combine the two grades to get an overall GPA: _________ 6. Identify where the optimum might occur Using only reasoning (no calculations): If Class B has more “room to grow,” will you likely spend more time there or less? Why? ________ If Class A’s grade cannot change much no matter how much you study, is it worth giving it many hours? ________ Explain in one sentence where the “balanced” point might be: ________ Qualitative Case Study — Optimizing Your Thanksgiving Plate Thanksgiving comes with a beautiful problem: there is more good food than you can (or should) eat. Your goal is to build the best possible plate given your limited appetite. 1.

For small additions, algae grow rapidly. But after a point, adding more nutrients leads to self-shading and oxygen depletion, which reduce productivity. A simple model for daily algal biomass produced (in grams) is: \\[ G(x) = 15x - 0.3x^2. \\] This model has no constraints: any non-negative \\(x\\) is allowed in the experimental design. Your Tasks 1. Understand the model a) What is the decision variable? b) What is the objective? c) Is this a maximization or a minimization problem? 2. Find the optimum Compute the derivative: \\[ G&#39;(x) = \\quad\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\] Find the critical point(s) by solving: \\[ G&#39;(x) = 0. \\] Critical point(s): \\[ x = \\quad\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\] 3.

Plug it into \\(G(x)\\) to compute the maximum biomass. \\[ G(x^{*}) = \\quad\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\] In ecological terms, why does productivity eventually decline at high nutrient levels? 5. Reflection (one sentence) Summarize the tradeoff revealed by this model: ___________________ Case Study 2 — Optimal Light Intensity for Photosynthesis (Unconstrained) In a greenhouse experiment, researchers control the intensity of artificial light reaching a plant canopy. At low light levels, photosynthesis increases rapidly. At high light levels, enzymes saturate and heat stress reduces efficiency. A simple model for photosynthetic rate (in µmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹) as a function of light intensity \\(I\\) (in arbitrary light units) is: \\[ P(I) = 40I - 0.5I^2. \\] There are no constraints on the light intensity: the researchers can set \\(I\\) to any non-negative value. Your Tasks 1. Understand the model a) What is the decision variable? b) What is the objective? c) Is this a maximization or minimization problem? 2. Find the optimum Compute the derivative: \\[ P&#39;(I) = \\quad\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\] Find the critical point(s) by solving: \\[ P&#39;(I) = 0. \\] Critical point(s): \\[ I = \\quad\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\] 3.

Reflection (one sentence) Summarize the biological tradeoff revealed by this model: ___________________ Quantitative Case Study 3 — Maximizing Volume with a Fixed Surface Area (Square Base) You are designing an open-topped water container for a restoration project. The container will have a square base, and you have 2 square meters of material available to build the base and the four sides. Because the container has no lid, only the bottom and four vertical walls use material. Let \\(x\\) = length of one side of the square base \\(H\\) = height of the container Your goal is to build the container with the maximum possible volume  Lifeguard Optimization Problem — Rescue Path Minimization A lifeguard stands on the shoreline at point A. A swimmer is in distress 100 meters down the beach and 100 meters offshore at point B. The lifeguard can: Run on sand at: \\(v_r = 6 \\text{ m/s}\\) Swim in water at: \\(v_s = 2 \\text{ m/s}\\) The lifeguard chooses a point C, located \\(x\\) meters down the beach, where they will enter the water and begin swimming. Tasks Write down the time function \\(T(x)\\) using the distances and speeds provided. Differentiate \\(T(x)\\) and set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical point. Solve for the optimal water-entry point \\(x\\) that minimizes the total rescue time. Interpret the result: Why is it optimal for the lifeguard to run farther down the beach before entering the water? Activity: Which Shape Maximizes Volume When Surface Area = 100? You are designing a container for an environmental monitoring project. You have exactly 100 units² of construction material. Your goal is to determine which shape produces the maximum possible volume using that fixed surface area. You will compare three shapes: Sphere Closed Cylinder (top and bottom included) Rectangular Prism with a square base Work through each part, then compare your results at the end. Part 1 — Sphere A sphere of radius \\(r\\) has: \\[ A = 4\\pi r^2 = 100, \\qquad V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3. \\] Tasks Solve for \\(r\\). Compute the volume. Solution Surface area \\[ 4\\pi r^2 = 100 \\Rightarrow r = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}. \\] Volume \\[ V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\right)^3 = \\frac{500}{3\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\approx 94.1. \\] Part 2 — Cylinder A cylinder with radius \\(r\\) and height \\(h\\) has: \\[ A = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r h = 100, \\qquad V = \\pi r^2 h. \\] Tasks Solve the surface-area constraint for \\(h\\). Substitute into \\(V\\). Optimize to find \\(r\\) and \\(h\\). Compute the max volume. Solution Constraint \\[ h = \\frac{100 - 2\\pi r^2}{2\\pi r}. \\] Volume \\[ V(r)=50r - \\pi r^3. \\] Derivative \\[ V&#39;(r)=50 - 3\\pi r^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow r=\\sqrt{\\frac{50}{3\\pi}}\\approx 2.304. \\] Height \\[ h=\\frac{100}{3\\pi r} \\approx 4.61. \\] Volume \\[ V \\approx 76.9. \\] Part 3 — Rectangular Prism (s Let the base be \\(x \\times x\\) and the height be \\(h\\): \\[ A = 2x^2 + 4xh = 100, \\qquad V = x^2 h. \\] Tasks Solve the constraint for \\(h\\).
